# strategy for taking note 
1. when it require you to draw a picture of said note, you should do this latter if you have the time, picture diagram that are in your slide usually contain this 
2. try to understand the concept of the section that the person is talking, like instead of writing down whole operation write the main one(the simply equation important final part) then go back on it bases on the side
3. you write note on your book so unhelpful, note should be look back upon not written then forgo

### ✍️ **Ideas for Personal Shortcut Use in Notes**

You can even invent your own consistent shortcuts for words like:

| Symbol  | Shortcut For                               | Example                            |
| ------- | ------------------------------------------ | ---------------------------------- |
| ≠       | "Not equal"                                | x≠yx ≠ y means x is not equal to y |
| ↑ ↓ → ← | "Increase, decrease, leads to, comes from" | Profit ↑ = good                    |
| ⟹       | "Leads to / Results in"                    | Mutation ⟹ Disease                 |
| #****   | "Number" or "count"                        | # of genes = 20,000                |
| %       | "Percent"                                  | 80% efficiency                     |
| ∆       | "Change in"                                | ∆x = x₂ - x₁                       |
| ~       | "Similar to"                               | A ~ B                              |
| @       | "At" (especially in locations)             | @ locus 7q31                       |
