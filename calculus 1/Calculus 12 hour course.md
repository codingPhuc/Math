$$
\frac{21}{45} =  \frac{7\cdot  3} { 5 \cdot 3 \cdot 3}  =  \frac{7}{15}  
$$


simplify $\frac{3x  +  6} {x^2 + 4x + 4}$ 
$\frac{3(x  + 2)} {x + 2 }  = \frac{3}{x+ 2 }$ 
# multply and divding 

$$
\frac{4}{3}  \cdot \frac{2}{5 }   = \frac{2\cdot  4}{5 \cdot 3 }
$$


$$
\frac{\frac{4}{5}}{\frac{2}{3}}  =  \frac{4}{5}  \cdot \frac{3}{2}   = \frac{12}{10}  = \frac{6}{5 }
$$
compute   $$
\frac{\frac{x^2+ x }{x  + 4}}{\frac{x+1}{x^2 - 16}}  = 
$$



## adding and sub fraction 

used LCD 
$$
\frac{7}{6} - \frac{4}{15}  =  \frac{35 -  8}{30} =  \frac{27}{30 }  =  \frac{9}{10}
 $$
add
$$\frac{3}{2x+2}  +\frac{5}{x^2 -1}= \frac{3}{2(x  + 1 )} +  \frac{5}{(x + 1 )(x - 1)}  =  \frac{3x  - 3 +  10  }{2 (x + 1 ) (x - 1)}  =  \frac{3x + 7 }{2 (x + 1 ) (x - 1)}  $$
1. write both denominator in factor form  
2. multiply each denominator by the  missing factor  to have a common denominator using LCD logic 
3. do the add or addition operation 





# Different Quotient 

for function $y= f(x)$ 

## secant line is 
a line between two points on the slope of a function 

## definition the average rate of change for f(x) on the interval [a, b] is 
The secant line bteween the two point (a, f(a))  ) (b , f(b)) 
$$
 m=  \frac{rise}{ }  = \frac{y}{x }  = \frac{f(b) -f(a)}{b - a }
$$
Example the average rate of change for $f(x)  =\sqrt{ x }$ on the interval [1,4] is 
$$  
m = \frac{f(4)-f(1)}{4 -1 }   = \frac{\sqrt{ 4 } = \sqrt{ 1 }}{3} =
\frac{2-1}{3} = \frac{1}{3}
$$


A different quotation represent 
the average of change of a the function f(x ) on the intenal is [x, x + h] 


$$
m  =  \frac{f(b) -  f( c)}{ b -a }   = \frac{f(x+h)}{}
$$

the average rule 



example find the and simplify the different quotation for $f(x)= 2x^2  - x  + 3$
different   quotation  =  $\frac{f(x+h) - f(x)}{h}$ 

$$
\begin{array}
f(x+h) = 2(x+ h)^2  - (x + h) + 3   \\
2 (x+ h ) (x + h  )  - x  -h  + 3   \\
= 2(x^2 + x + h x + h^2 )  - x  - h  + 3  \\
= 2x^2 + 2xh + 2hx  + 2h^2 - x - h  + 3  \\
 =   2x^2 + 4xh + 2h^2 - x -h + 3 
\end{array}
$$
$$
\begin{array}
f(x+h) - f(x )   =    2x^2  = 4xh  + 2h^2  -x - h + 3 - (2x^2 -x + 3)  \\
= 2x^2 + 4xh  + 2h^2  -x -h + 3  - 2x^2  + x  - 3  \\
= 4xh  + 2h^2 -h  \\
\end{array}

$$

$$
\frac{f(x   +h )- f(x)} { h }  = \frac{4xh + 2h^2  -h}{ h }  =  \frac{h(4x + 2x -1)}{h}  = (4x + 2x -1)
$$



## Graphs and limits 

example :  julia suice  18:55 

write a n equation y =F(x ) as a piecewise definition function 

$$
\{\begin{array} 
  0  \text{if } x  = 1  \\
10x \text{ if} x  \neq 1
\end{array}
$$
describe the behavior of  f(x ) when x is near 1 but is not equal to one 
describe the behavior of f(x) when x is near 1 but not equal to 1 


for real number a and L  ,  

not equal    $\lim_{ n \to 1 } \neq f(1)=10$ 
defintion for real number a and 


let say that the limit only care for the value that approach the desire value in this case a from both side the of  x axis  






## Descibe the behavior of $y=g(x )$  when x is near 2 

$$
\lim_{  x \to 2   } g(x) Dne   
$$


the picutre describe how the limit does not continue after the value  2 but cut of 

in the left side of the limit  
$$
\lim_{ n \to 2 }  =  1  
$$
right side of limit 
$$
\lim_{ n \to 2^+ }  = 3
$$



this section about how the direction of the limit affect the result of the function if the limit approaching 2  from either direction causing the function values to be negative then we say that the limit is a - . On the other hand, if the limit cause the function to be positive value then we say that it have a  + notation in the above 

the image here is saying that the limit approaching from left to right cause the F val to be pos  while the other cause the f val to be neg 


## last example 

look at the graph when x is negative 2  
y value is large larger than any real val we can choose right to left approach infi 
if the left to  right then it is  -  
the limit in the right and left does not exit since it does not hit -2 


- introduce the idea of limt 
- infinite limit 
- one sided limit 




	## for the function f(x) graphed below 

what is 
$$
\lim_{ x \to -1^- }   f(x ) = \frac{1}{2}
$$
 $$
\lim_{ x \to -1^+ }  f(x)  = 1  
$$
$$
\lim_{ n \to -1 }  DDne  
$$
this section talk about 

## note way that limit cannot exit 

1. limit from the left != limit from the right
