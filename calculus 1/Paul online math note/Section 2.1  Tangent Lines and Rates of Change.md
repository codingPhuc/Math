the general  formula in the source for generating the two points, the slope formula. We need this to find the slope of the secant line in order to find the slopes of the tangent line the formula require 2 point, the first point the point where the graph and tangent line touch. The second point we need to create our self, which can be on either side of the first point by plugging a choosen x access to create a y access in the graph 
the formula is : 
$slope=\frac{f(x )  -  f(a)}{x -a}$
but if we plug in any number it will cause the slope to be less accurate since we don't know if the point is in the tangent line or not. As a result, it is recomended to used a cooridinate that is closet to the touch point as possible since this will eable us to get the most accurate slope 


$$
h(x) =  \frac{ f(h +a) + -f(a) }{h_}
$$
