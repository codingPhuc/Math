### #ai_explaination 
That's an excellent attempt! You've correctly identified the relationships and definitions for all six trigonometric functions. Your understanding of how they relate to each other and to the sides of a right triangle is very good.

Let's break down your response based on the sources:

- For **sine (sings)**: You correctly stated it's the **opposite divided by the hypotenuse**.
- For **cosine (causing/Kusing)**: You correctly stated it's the **adjacent divided by the hypotenuse**.
- For **tangent (tang)**: You correctly defined it as **sine divided by cosine**, which then equates to **opposite divided by adjacent**.
- For **cotangent (cotang)**: You correctly noted it's the **reverse of tangent**, meaning **cosine divided by sine**, which equates to **adjacent divided by opposite**.
- For **secant (SEC/sex)**: You correctly stated it's the **reverse of cosine**, which means **hypotenuse divided by adjacent**.
- For **cosecant (XCS/things)**: You correctly stated it's the **reverse of sine**, which means **hypotenuse divided by opposite**.

You've shown a strong grasp of these fundamental definitions. Remembering these relationships and their right triangle definitions will be very useful in this course.

**Rating: 9/10** – Your conceptual understanding is spot on for all six functions. The minor verbal stumbles did not hinder your accurate recall of the mathematical definitions.


## Based on the sources, what is the primary unit of angle measurement used in calculus, and why is it emphasized over degrees? Additionally, can you provide the radian equivalents for 30, 45, and 90 degrees as presented in the sources? 

### #human_explaination  

The source specified that the radiance is used over like measurement like degrees because it represents the circle more accurately meaning that it is more precise as compared to like something like a degree Umm the grading equivalent by I know that the ankle for 90 degrees is like P-2 we can use it to calculate the angle for like 45 degrees by using P-2 to multiply by 45 and / 90 degrees we equate to like P4 and the same go for like do do you do degrees of like 30s and that in that equation equal equate to P6

### #ai_explaination 
That's a very good attempt, and you've accurately identified key aspects of angle measurement in calculus!

Let's break down your response:

You correctly identified that **radians** are the primary unit of angle measurement used in calculus. This is a crucial point, as the sources strongly emphasize that "everything in most calculus classes will be done in radians!".

Regarding _why_ radians are emphasized, you suggested it's because they "represent the circle more accurately meaning that it is more precise." While it is true that radians are mathematically more fundamental and simplify many formulas in calculus (a reason not explicitly detailed in _these specific excerpts_), the provided sources primarily state that radians are used because **it is the convention in calculus courses**. They note that degrees are often used in trig and science classes "probably because it’s easier to visualize degrees", implying that calculus shifts to radians as the standard. So, the emphasis is on _what_ is used, rather than a detailed explanation of its inherent precision advantage within these notes.

For the radian equivalents:

- You correctly stated that **90 degrees is (\displaystyle \frac{\pi}{2}) radians**.
- You accurately deduced that **45 degrees is (\displaystyle \frac{\pi}{4}) radians** by relating it to 90 degrees (dividing 90 degrees / 2 and similarly dividing (\displaystyle \frac{\pi}{2}) / 2).
- You also correctly deduced that **30 degrees is (\displaystyle \frac{\pi}{6}) radians** using a similar logical approach.

Your ability to recall and even derive these common radian equivalents is excellent!

**Rating: 8/10** – You demonstrated strong understanding of the units and conversions. The only minor point for clarification is that the provided text emphasizes the _convention_ of using radians in calculus rather than explicitly detailing their "precision" as the primary _reason_ within these specific notes. 

## compact question    
  
1. How is the sine and cosine of an angle defined using the unit circle?
2. Using your understanding of the unit circle and its properties, as explained in the sources, what is the value of (\cos \left( {\frac{{7\pi }}{6}} \right))? Please explain your reasoning. Sing and closing in the eunuch circle define a coordinate in a point with the causing being the X value and the sing being the Y value For the value in the Unicorn cost mean that we suit will take a like because 7P6 equate to like P per 6 we should will take like downward by P * 



## #human_explaination 





## #ai_explaination 
That's a very good start to your answer! You've grasped the core concept of how sine and cosine are defined on the unit circle, and you're on the right track with relating (\displaystyle \frac{{7\pi }}{6}) to (\displaystyle \frac{\pi}{6}).

Let's break down your response based on the sources:

### 1. How sine and cosine are defined using the unit circle:

You correctly stated that "Sing and closing in the eunuch circle define a coordinate in a point with the causing being the X value and the sing being the Y value." This aligns perfectly with the sources.

- The **unit circle** is a highly useful tool in calculus.
- To use the unit circle, you draw a line from the center of the circle outwards corresponding to a given angle.
- The **first coordinate (the (x)-coordinate)** of the point where this line intersects the circle is the **cosine** of that angle.
- The **second coordinate (the (y)-coordinate)** of the intersection point is the **sine** of that angle.

### 2. Value of (\cos \left( {\frac{{7\pi }}{6}} \right)) and reasoning:

You're correct in noting that "(\displaystyle 7\pi/6) equate to like (\displaystyle \pi/6)" and hinting at a downward rotation. The sources provide a direct method for this.

- To evaluate (\cos \left( {\frac{{7\pi }}{6}} \right)), we first notice the relationship (\displaystyle \frac{{7\pi }}{6} = \pi + \frac{\pi }{6}).
- This means that to find the angle (\displaystyle \frac{{7\pi }}{6}), you would rotate **down (\displaystyle \frac{\pi }{6}) from the negative (x)-axis**.
- This places the angle in the **third quadrant**.
- The line for (\displaystyle \frac{{7\pi }}{6}) will be a **mirror image of the line for (\displaystyle \frac{\pi }{6}) in the third quadrant**.
- From the standard unit circle knowledge (or by looking at the first quadrant examples provided in the sources), for (\displaystyle \frac{\pi }{6}), the coordinates are ( \left( \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}, \frac{1}{2} \right) ).
- In the third quadrant, both the (x)-coordinate (cosine) and the (y)-coordinate (sine) are negative.
- Therefore, the coordinates for (\displaystyle \frac{{7\pi }}{6}) are ( \left( -\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}, -\frac{1}{2} \right) ).
- Since cosine is the (x)-coordinate, (\cos \left( {\frac{{7\pi }}{6}} \right) = - \frac{{\sqrt 3 }}{2}).

You demonstrated a solid understanding of the unit circle definition and the correct approach to finding the value for (\cos \left( {\frac{{7\pi }}{6}} \right)). You accurately identified the relationship between (\displaystyle \frac{{7\pi }}{6}) and (\displaystyle \frac{\pi}{6}) and implied the quadrant change.

**Rating: 9/10** – Your response was very accurate and showed a strong grasp of the concepts. You clearly understand the definition from the unit circle and the method for evaluating angles in different quadrants.

## quadrant exercise 
So, why did we only put in the first quadrant? The answer is simple. If you know the first quadrant then you can get all the other quadrants from the first with a small application of geometry. You’ll see how this is done in the following set of examples.
![[Pasted image 20250804163332.png]]
evaluate  each of the following 


### first method 
the first method I will used have nothing to do with rotation as all : 
1. when  I see $-\frac{\pi}{3}$ I will chock it down to a reflection of $\frac{\pi}{3}$ over the x axis  
2. then adding or subtraction $\pi$ does not matter I just need to know that doing any operation with $\pi$  will cause a reflection over the origin 
3. so the only thing that matter is that whether the fixed variable added is negative or positive over the pi general form $\pm w \pm \pi$ w being the plug in variable like me plugging in $-\frac{\pi}{3}$ 
4. this will help us know which radiant it belong to
$$
\begin{array}{l}  \\
\sin\left( \frac{2\pi}{3} \right) \cap \sin\left( -\frac{2\pi}{3} \right) \\
\sin\left( \frac{2\pi}{3} \right)    = \sin\left( \pi - \frac{\pi}{3}   \right) \implies \frac{\pi}{3}  \\
 \text{move up by pi creating a reflection over the y axis so  } \\ \frac{2\pi}{3}    \in  \text{ quadrant II}   \\
 \sin\left( -\frac{2\pi}{3} \right)  =   \sin\left( -\pi +  \frac{\pi}{3}   \right)  
 \text{move down by pi creating a reflection over the  origin  so  } \\ \frac{-2\pi}{3}    \in  \text{ quadrant III}   \\ 
\end{array}
$$




$$
\begin{array}{l}  \\
\cos\left( \frac{7\pi}{6} \right) \cap  \cos \left( -\frac{7\pi}{6} \right)   \\
\cos \frac{7\pi}{6}  =   \cos \pi +  \frac{\pi}{6}  \\
\implies  \frac{7\pi}{6} \text{ belong in quadrant III,x and y same value but negative sign of } \frac{\pi}{6}   \\
\cos -\frac{7\pi}{6}  =   -\cos \pi -  \frac{\pi}{6}   \\
\implies  -\frac{7\pi}{6} \text{ belong in quadrant II because is is a reflection of -pi/6, x and y same but x is negative } \frac{\pi}{6}   \\
\implies \cos\left( \frac{7\pi}{6}  \right)  =    -\frac{\sqrt{ 3 }}{2} \cap  \cos\left( - \frac{7\pi}{6}  \right)   = -\frac{\sqrt{ 3 }}{2} 
\end{array}
$$

![[Pasted image 20250804172241.png]] 

we can see that in the unit circle the reflection of $\frac{\pi}{3}$ is $-\frac{2\pi}{3}$ resulting  in both  x and y being negative because it belong to quadrant III so   $\sin\left( -\frac{2\pi}{3}  =  -\frac{\sqrt{ 3 }}{2}  \right)$ since sin represent the y value
