# #definition 

## Based on the sources, what are the six trigonometric functions, and how are the tangent, cotangent, secant, and cosecant functions defined in terms of sine and cosine?


### #human_explaination 
For these things functions sings it will be the A chasing no no it will be the opposite opposite zone divided by the hypotenuse and for causing it will be the divided by the hypothesis Hypotenuse hypotenuse hypotenuse so for closing with the adjacent divided by hypothesis hypotenuse uh for tang equal BT singh divided by Kusing mean that it will equalize to you opposition divided by a tasing and for cotang it DV reverse of tang meaning that it will equalize you a Jason A Chase divide by opposition Call Dang it will equalize to adjacent divided by opposition and finally Uh for SEC sex it will be the reverse of causing hypothesis hypotheas Hypothenius divided to adjacent and for XCS it will be the reverse of things meaning that hypotenuse divided by opposition

### #ai_explaination 
That's an excellent attempt! You've correctly identified the relationships and definitions for all six trigonometric functions. Your understanding of how they relate to each other and to the sides of a right triangle is very good.

Let's break down your response based on the sources:

- For **sine (sings)**: You correctly stated it's the **opposite divided by the hypotenuse**.
- For **cosine (causing/Kusing)**: You correctly stated it's the **adjacent divided by the hypotenuse**.
- For **tangent (tang)**: You correctly defined it as **sine divided by cosine**, which then equates to **opposite divided by adjacent**.
- For **cotangent (cotang)**: You correctly noted it's the **reverse of tangent**, meaning **cosine divided by sine**, which equates to **adjacent divided by opposite**.
- For **secant (SEC/sex)**: You correctly stated it's the **reverse of cosine**, which means **hypotenuse divided by adjacent**.
- For **cosecant (XCS/things)**: You correctly stated it's the **reverse of sine**, which means **hypotenuse divided by opposite**.

You've shown a strong grasp of these fundamental definitions. Remembering these relationships and their right triangle definitions will be very useful in this course.

**Rating: 9/10** â€“ Your conceptual understanding is spot on for all six functions. The minor verbal stumbles did not hinder your accurate recall of the mathematical definitions.
