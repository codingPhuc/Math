## Practice 1 
Example 2 solve  
$$
\begin{array}{l}  \\
-10 \cos(3t) =  7  \in  [-2,5]  \\
 \implies  2.3461  \text{ this the first angle } \\
 - 2.3461 +  2\pi   =  3.937   \text{ this is the second angle}
\end{array}
$$
so the solution to the trig equation is  : 
$$
\begin{array}{l} \\

\end{array}
$$
