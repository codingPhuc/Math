information theory  
usefull informaiton entrophe work with each other proper informaiton thoery how to read like graph, read population sampling 
linear algrebra matrix is serious 
neuro map is matrix multiple 

tensor is made of a cornal each tensor is a group of matrix algorithm look though it and match  the simlarity sadsadsadasdsadasdsafasdasdsadsadsadsadasdsadsa

power bell work populary  
how to make 
random forest a bunch of decision tree basic form of machine learning, yes no for anything that is accurate, this is what frog look like and this is what frog does not look like 
feeding it more information 
guideson map, the bell curve is the middle

change how the pari matrix look at the matrix  
if 2 +3  = 5 is wrong,
deep learning where the model learn for it self 
random forest tree  create  a  neuro network  and making sure that data is okay really inefficient for high 
random  forest used for  tax fraud ,  like if it look in mark off heat map turn the bell curve into a

blue  less likely  to happend 
you can used  random forest tree to see what it is happening 

multual information is how much x will affect y  
stock in multual distribution properbilty of x y with x nvial  y  fedx  
function of  nvidia and amazon ,  amazon
if no one ship nvidia ship  
multual information explaining the realationship between 2 variable 
an umbela depend perfectly on the weather 

if the variable perfectly depend on the weather sunny or rainy,
popubility  function you p defly  the variable x  either sunny or  rainy. define y as yes or no 
in a perfect world where there is high multiple informaiton if it raining then you bring the umbela 
if the umbela used is whether sunny or rainy  you will bring the umbela even if it sunny so x variable does not impact y 

if nvidia have no chip to sell then fedx will either not  deliver or deliver, ship a lot or not depending on nvidia not production
