how to make 
random forest a bunch of decision tree basic form of machine learning, yes no for anything that is accurate, this is what frog look like and this is what frog does not look like 
feeding it more information

change how the pari matrix look at the matrix  
if 2 +3  = 5 is wrong,
deep learning where the model learn for it self 
random forest tree  create  a  neuro network  and making sure that data is okay really inefficient for high 
random  forest used for  tax fraud ,  like if it look in mark off heat map turn the bell curve into a

you can used  random forest tree to see what it is happening
