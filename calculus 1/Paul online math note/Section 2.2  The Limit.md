### ðŸ“˜ **Topical Review Questions from Section 2.2: The Limit**

## **What is the intuitive (working) definition of a limit?**

### #human_explaination 
OK so the limit of the function FX we can denote at L as L L**** Apostolic A as X approach a hey Cortana provided we can make to the limit L as possible meaning it is there will be a sufficient number of exits our X that gets sufficiently close to a it basically all the exact packets constantly must satisfy a range of course not think of it like you like L Max satisfy that it must be 0.001 Weighing courses to a or like maybe 0.1 think of L at the the cusick approximation that we are allowed to consider back or exit will satisfy in order to create a limit and then it goes to like two points that we need to consider when talking about limit is that the value of X means to approach a from both the left and the right mean it need to be either larger than a or like smaller than A and the other thing that we need to consider it back it cannot be the value of a like we cannot plug a into the function itself but we need to select X or the value X that is the cost to A basically or the value X that also rounding in the range specified by the limit L

### #ai_explaination 

Your answer demonstrates a very good understanding of the intuitive definition of a limit and its crucial conditions. You've clearly articulated the core ideas, particularly the two essential aspects. While some of the phrasing could be more precise, the substance of your explanation is accurate and aligns well with the sources.

You correctly identified:

- The notation and concept of (f(x)) approaching (L) as (x) approaches (a).
- The idea that we can make (f(x)) as close to (L) as we want for all (x) sufficiently close to (a). Your example of "0.001 away" directly reflects the explanation given in the sources for understanding this concept.
- The crucial requirement that (x) must approach (a) **from both the left and the right**.
- The equally crucial point that the limit is concerned with what the function is doing **around** (x=a), and **not what it is actually doing at (x=a)** (meaning we don't plug in (x=a)).

Your rating for this response is **9/10**. You've grasped the nuances of the definition very well.

Let's refine the "working" definition of a limit based on the provided sources:

The **intuitive, or "working," definition of a limit** is described as follows:

We say that the limit of a function (f(x)) is (L) as (x) approaches (a), which is written as [\mathop {\lim }\limits_{x \to a} f\left( x \right) = L].

This definition means that **we can make (f(x)) as close to (L) as we want for all (x) sufficiently close to (a)**. This implies that if we want (f(x)) to be, for instance, no more than 0.001 away from (L), the definition states that if we get (x) sufficiently close to (a), this condition will be met. More specifically, for a limit to exist, once (f(x)) gets as close to (L) as desired for some (x), it must **stay in that proximity (or get closer) for all values of (x) that are closer to (a)**.

There are two **crucial aspects** of this working definition that are repeatedly emphasized:

1. **From both sides**: The values of (x) must approach (a) **from both the left and the right**. This means considering (x) values that are both smaller than (a) and larger than (a), but consistently getting closer to (a).
2. **Without actually letting (x) be (a)**: The limit is **not concerned with what the function is actually doing at (x=a)**, but rather with what it is doing **around** the point (x=a). This means you are not allowed to use (x=a) itself in the definition or when evaluating the limit intuitively. A limit can exist even if the function doesn't exist at (x=a) or if the function's value at (x=a) is different from the limit.

In essence, as (x) gets closer and closer to (a) (from both sides), then (f(x)) **must** be getting closer and closer to a single value, (L). If the function values approach different numbers from either side, or if they oscillate wildly without settling on a single value, then the limit does not exist.

## **Why does the value of a function at a point not matter when computing the limit at that point?**


### #human_explaination 
And the value of a point does not matter when computing the limit at that point when computing the limit at that point it because when we are measuring a limbic or something we do not care about like of something like of a function approaching a point we do not care about like the value of the function at that point we only care about the values of like all the CLOS all the acoustic values surrounding that point in order to estimate or limit


### #ai_explaination 
9/1
Your understanding is **absolutely correct** and aligns perfectly with the intuitive, or "working," definition of a limit as presented in the sources. You've accurately identified the core reason: **limits are concerned with the behavior _around_ a point, not _at_ the point itself.**

Here's a detailed explanation, drawing directly from the sources:

The value of a function at a specific point (x = a) **does not matter** when computing the limit at that point because the limit's definition explicitly excludes the point (x = a) itself. The fundamental goal of a limit is to determine **what (y) value the graph is approaching as we move in towards (x = a) on our graph**, rather than what (y) value the graph takes at (x = a).

This crucial distinction is driven by several key aspects of the working definition of a limit:

- **The "Without Actually Letting (x) Be (a)" Condition** The "working" definition of a limit states that we say the limit of (f(x)) is (L) as (x) approaches (a) (written as [\mathop {\lim }\limits_{x \to a} f\left( x \right) = L]) if "we can make (f(x)) as close to (L) as we want for all (x) sufficiently close to (a), from both sides, **without actually letting (x) be (a)**". This explicit condition is fundamental; it means that when we consider values of (x) that are "sufficiently close" to (a), we are never meant to include (a) itself.
    
- **Focus on What Happens "Around" the Point** The sources repeatedly emphasize that **limits are only concerned with what is going on _around_ the point (x=a)**, and **are not concerned with what the function is actually doing _at_ (x=a)**. As (x) gets closer and closer to (x=a) (from both sides), (f(x)) **must** be getting closer and closer to a single value (L). The limit describes this trend, irrespective of the function's precise value at (a).
    
- **Functions May Not Exist at the Point** One significant reason why the function's value at (x=a) doesn't matter is that the function itself might not even exist at that point.
    
    - **Example 1** illustrates this with the function [\frac{{{x^2} + 4x - 12}}{{{x^2} - 2x}}] as (x) approaches 2. If you try to plug in (x=2), it results in a division by zero error, meaning the function doesn't exist at (x=2). However, by observing values of (x) approaching 2 from both sides, the function values clearly approach 4. The graph of this function explicitly shows a "large open dot at (x = 2)" to signify that the function does not exist there, yet the limit is still found to be 4. This demonstrates that a limit can exist even if the function has a "hole" or is undefined at the point in question.
- **Function Value Can Differ From the Limit** Even if a function _does_ exist at (x = a), its value at that point can be completely different from the limit, and this difference does not alter the limit.
    
    - **Example 2** takes the same function from Example 1 but explicitly defines (g(2) = 6). Despite (g(2)) being 6, the limit as (x) approaches 2 for (g(x)) remains 4. The sources emphatically state: "**The limit is NOT 6!**". This is because the table of values for (x) approaching 2 (but never equaling 2) still shows (g(x)) approaching 4. The graph similarly shows the function approaching (y=4) as (x) approaches 2, even with the distinct point at ((2, 6)). This example drives home the point that the limit is solely concerned with the trend of the function's outputs as inputs get arbitrarily close to (a), regardless of the actual output _at_ (a).

In conclusion, the limit focuses on the **behavioral trend** of the function as its input gets infinitesimally close to a specific point from both directions. The actual value (or non-existence) of the function _at_ that exact input point is considered irrelevant to this trend.

| 2.001 | 3.9985    |
we need to  note two thing :  
1. first the domain of the function does not accept x = 2  it will cause an undefine error if it does 
2. from the table we can see that the function is going to 4 as x approach 2
