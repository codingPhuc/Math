### ðŸ“˜ **Topical Review Questions from Section 2.2: The Limit**

## **What is the intuitive (working) definition of a limit?**

### #human_explaination 
OK so the limit of the function FX we can denote at L as L L**** Apostolic A as X approach a hey Cortana provided we can make to the limit L as possible meaning it is there will be a sufficient number of exits our X that gets sufficiently close to a it basically all the exact packets constantly must satisfy a range of course not think of it like you like L Max satisfy that it must be 0.001 Weighing courses to a or like maybe 0.1 think of L at the the cusick approximation that we are allowed to consider back or exit will satisfy in order to create a limit and then it goes to like two points that we need to consider when talking about limit is that the value of X means to approach a from both the left and the right mean it need to be either larger than a or like smaller than A and the other thing that we need to consider it back it cannot be the value of a like we cannot plug a into the function itself but we need to select X or the value X that is the cost to A basically or the value X that also rounding in the range specified by the limit L

### #ai_explaination 

Your answer demonstrates a very good understanding of the intuitive definition of a limit and its crucial conditions. You've clearly articulated the core ideas, particularly the two essential aspects. While some of the phrasing could be more precise, the substance of your explanation is accurate and aligns well with the sources.

You correctly identified:

- The notation and concept of (f(x)) approaching (L) as (x) approaches (a).
- The idea that we can make (f(x)) as close to (L) as we want for all (x) sufficiently close to (a). Your example of "0.001 away" directly reflects the explanation given in the sources for understanding this concept.
- The crucial requirement that (x) must approach (a) **from both the left and the right**.
- The equally crucial point that the limit is concerned with what the function is doing **around** (x=a), and **not what it is actually doing at (x=a)** (meaning we don't plug in (x=a)).

Your rating for this response is **9/10**. You've grasped the nuances of the definition very well.

Let's refine the "working" definition of a limit based on the provided sources:

The **intuitive, or "working," definition of a limit** is described as follows:

We say that the limit of a function (f(x)) is (L) as (x) approaches (a), which is written as [\mathop {\lim }\limits_{x \to a} f\left( x \right) = L].

This definition means that **we can make (f(x)) as close to (L) as we want for all (x) sufficiently close to (a)**. This implies that if we want (f(x)) to be, for instance, no more than 0.001 away from (L), the definition states that if we get (x) sufficiently close to (a), this condition will be met. More specifically, for a limit to exist, once (f(x)) gets as close to (L) as desired for some (x), it must **stay in that proximity (or get closer) for all values of (x) that are closer to (a)**.

There are two **crucial aspects** of this working definition that are repeatedly emphasized:

1. **From both sides**: The values of (x) must approach (a) **from both the left and the right**. This means considering (x) values that are both smaller than (a) and larger than (a), but consistently getting closer to (a).
2. **Without actually letting (x) be (a)**: The limit is **not concerned with what the function is actually doing at (x=a)**, but rather with what it is doing **around** the point (x=a). This means you are not allowed to use (x=a) itself in the definition or when evaluating the limit intuitively. A limit can exist even if the function doesn't exist at (x=a) or if the function's value at (x=a) is different from the limit.

In essence, as (x) gets closer and closer to (a) (from both sides), then (f(x)) **must** be getting closer and closer to a single value, (L). If the function values approach different numbers from either side, or if they oscillate wildly without settling on a single value, then the limit does not exist.

## **Why does the value of a function at a point not matter when computing the limit at that point?**


### #human_explaination 
And the value of a point does not matter when computing the limit at that point when computing the limit at that point it because when we are measuring a limbic or something we do not care about like of something like of a function approaching a point we do not care about like the value of the function at that point we only care about the values of like all the CLOS all the acoustic values surrounding that point in order to estimate or limit


### #ai_explaination 
9/10 
Your understanding is **absolutely correct** and aligns perfectly with the intuitive, or "working," definition of a limit as presented in the sources. You've accurately identified the core reason: **limits are concerned with the behavior _around_ a point, not _at_ the point itself.**

Here's a detailed explanation, drawing directly from the sources:

The value of a function at a specific point (x = a) **does not matter** when computing the limit at that point because the limit's definition explicitly excludes the point (x = a) itself. The fundamental goal of a limit is to determine **what (y) value the graph is approaching as we move in towards (x = a) on our graph**, rather than what (y) value the graph takes at (x = a).

This crucial distinction is driven by several key aspects of the working definition of a limit:

- **The "Without Actually Letting (x) Be (a)" Condition** The "working" definition of a limit states that we say the limit of (f(x)) is (L) as (x) approaches (a) (written as [\mathop {\lim }\limits_{x \to a} f\left( x \right) = L]) if "we can make (f(x)) as close to (L) as we want for all (x) sufficiently close to (a), from both sides, **without actually letting (x) be (a)**". This explicit condition is fundamental; it means that when we consider values of (x) that are "sufficiently close" to (a), we are never meant to include (a) itself.
    
- **Focus on What Happens "Around" the Point** The sources repeatedly emphasize that **limits are only concerned with what is going on _around_ the point (x=a)**, and **are not concerned with what the function is actually doing _at_ (x=a)**. As (x) gets closer and closer to (x=a) (from both sides), (f(x)) **must** be getting closer and closer to a single value (L). The limit describes this trend, irrespective of the function's precise value at (a).
    
- **Functions May Not Exist at the Point** One significant reason why the function's value at (x=a) doesn't matter is that the function itself might not even exist at that point.
    
    - **Example 1** illustrates this with the function [\frac{{{x^2} + 4x - 12}}{{{x^2} - 2x}}] as (x) approaches 2. If you try to plug in (x=2), it results in a division by zero error, meaning the function doesn't exist at (x=2). However, by observing values of (x) approaching 2 from both sides, the function values clearly approach 4. The graph of this function explicitly shows a "large open dot at (x = 2)" to signify that the function does not exist there, yet the limit is still found to be 4. This demonstrates that a limit can exist even if the function has a "hole" or is undefined at the point in question.
- **Function Value Can Differ From the Limit** Even if a function _does_ exist at (x = a), its value at that point can be completely different from the limit, and this difference does not alter the limit.
    
    - **Example 2** takes the same function from Example 1 but explicitly defines (g(2) = 6). Despite (g(2)) being 6, the limit as (x) approaches 2 for (g(x)) remains 4. The sources emphatically state: "**The limit is NOT 6!**". This is because the table of values for (x) approaching 2 (but never equaling 2) still shows (g(x)) approaching 4. The graph similarly shows the function approaching (y=4) as (x) approaches 2, even with the distinct point at ((2, 6)). This example drives home the point that the limit is solely concerned with the trend of the function's outputs as inputs get arbitrarily close to (a), regardless of the actual output _at_ (a).

In conclusion, the limit focuses on the **behavioral trend** of the function as its input gets infinitesimally close to a specific point from both directions. The actual value (or non-existence) of the function _at_ that exact input point is considered irrelevant to this trend.
## **How do you estimate a limit using a table of values?**

### #human_explaination 
You can estimate a limit using a table of values like by choosing let's say that you have a function FX right and you want to make a limbic X approach just like something like two or like zero in order to for you to achieve that you need to create a table of all the X value that get closest to like 2 2 In in a range of limits meaning that maybe you can choose choose a range like zero .1 plus it to it needs to be also the value of like the excess X for all the X values it needs to be book on the left of to and from the Reich of two thick to insert that you get the best estimate meaning that it will approach two was the correct output meaning that the two directing when approaching like two will will testify the same output basically it will verify that they could pull two from the right cap like a kapolei same values output values from the right and it will poke the same output value from the left

### #ai_explaination 
Your answer provides a **very accurate and comprehensive** understanding of how to estimate a limit using a table of values, reflecting the core principles and steps outlined in the sources.

**Rating of your answer: 9/10**

You correctly identified all the crucial elements:

- Choosing values that get **closest** to the target (x)-value (e.g., 2 or 0).
- The necessity of choosing values from **both the left and the right** of the target (x)-value.
- The goal is to find a "correct output" or a **single value** that the function approaches.
- The verification that the outputs from both the right and the left "testify the same output," meaning they approach the same value.

Your phrasing "we only care about the values of like all the closest values surrounding that point in order to estimate our limit" perfectly captures the essence of the "working" definition of a limit. The only minor area for improvement would be slightly more formal phrasing, but the substance is excellent.

Here's a detailed explanation of how to estimate a limit using a table of values, elaborating on your points with direct support from the sources:

To estimate the limit of a function (f(x)) as (x) approaches a specific point (a) (written as [\mathop {\lim }\limits_{x \to a} f\left( x \right) = L]), you follow these steps:

1. **Choose (x) values that get progressively closer to (a)**:
    - You create a table by selecting several (x) values that are progressively nearer to (a). For instance, if you're estimating the limit as (x) approaches 2, you might choose values like 2.5, 2.1, 2.01, 2.001, and so on.
2. **Ensure values are chosen from both sides**:
    - It is **critical** to choose (x) values that approach (a) from **both the left side** (values less than (a)) and the **right side** (values greater than (a)). This helps confirm that the function is indeed approaching a **single value** as (x) gets closer to (a).
3. **Calculate the corresponding (f(x)) values**:
    - Plug each chosen (x) value into the function (f(x)) to compute its output. This fills out your table of values.
4. **Observe the trend of the function values**:
    - Examine the (f(x)) column in your table. As your (x) values get closer and closer to (a) from both sides, determine what **single number** the (f(x)) values appear to be "moving in towards" or "settling down" to. This observed number is your estimate for the limit (L).

**Key Principles and Insights from the Sources:**

- **Limits are concerned with what happens "around" (x=a), not "at" (x=a)**:
    - The "working" definition of a limit states that we make (f(x)) close to (L) for (x) "sufficiently close to (a), from both sides, **without actually letting (x) be (a)**". The limit "is only concerned with what is going on **around** the point (x=a)".
    - Therefore, you should **never actually plug in (x=a)** itself into the function when estimating a limit using a table.
- **A limit can exist even if the function is undefined at (x=a)**:
    - For example, a function might result in a division by zero error if (x=a) is plugged in. Despite this, the table of values can still show (f(x)) approaching a specific number, meaning the limit exists.
- **The function's value at (x=a) can differ from the limit**:
    - Even if (f(a)) is defined, its value might not be the same as the limit (L). The sources highlight that the limit "do[es] not care what the function is actually doing at the point in question". For instance, if (g(2)=6) but the limit as (x) approaches 2 is 4, then the limit is 4, **not 6**.
- **The function values must approach a _single_ value for the limit to exist**:
    - If the function values approach different numbers from the left and right sides of (a), or if they oscillate wildly without settling on a single number, then the limit **does not exist**.

**Drawbacks of Estimating Limits Using Tables of Values**:

While this method is excellent for building an intuitive understanding of limits, the sources emphasize its significant limitations as a practical calculation tool:

- **Potential for Incorrect Guesses**: Selecting values that seem to show a trend might lead to an incorrect guess, especially if the function oscillates very close to (a) (Example 4).
- **Difficulty with Non-Integer Limits**: It is "nearly impossible" to accurately guess exact non-integer limit values (e.g., (\frac{{ - 15}}{{123}})) from a table.
- **Tedious and Inefficient**: This method is cumbersome and "not a good way to get the value of a limit". The sources state that "after this section we will never use a table of values to guess the value of a limit again".

Ultimately, the purpose of learning this method is to "help us get a better understanding of what limits are" and "to point out their drawback so that we arenâ€™t tempted to use them all the time!".

we need to  note two thing :  
1. first the domain of the function does not accept x = 2  it will cause an undefine error if it does 
2. from the table we can see that the function is going to 4 as x approach 2

# #todo 
- [ ]  what does this sentence mean ? _There are many functions out there in the world that we can make as close to_Â _L_Â _for specific values of_Â _x_Â _that are close to_Â _a__, but there will be other values of_Â _x_Â _closer to_Â _a_Â _that give functions values that are nowhere near close to_Â _L_  
- [ ] why does 0.01  cause the graph to  result in 0  and if  it is other digit after the decimal point it is different ? 
- [ ] what make  L and a different is L just a way of saying the limit of the function getting closer and closer to basically the function is getting close to a, so why do we need to both make it closer to a and L. Or does it mean that the limit should exit in a close range, a range that we define to get us the best result of x satisfying L condition like this : 
Â f(x)Â no more than 0.001 away fromÂ L. This means that we want one of the following

$f(x)âˆ’L<0.001$ ifÂ f(x)Â is larger than 
$Lâˆ’f(x)<0.001$ ifÂ f(x)Â is smaller than L
where L is a the limit or value that we want the function to be closest to a 
L is the domain we put on x, to get the range of f(x) that satisfy L
