Sure! Here's your list converted into link format. Each topic is followed by the most relevant link from Paul’s Online Math Notes (tutorial.math.lamar.edu), matched based on your module content:

### [[Rational Expressions]]

- [Review](https://tutorial.math.lamar.edu/Classes/CalcI/ReviewIntro.aspx)
    

### [[Difference Quotient]]

- [Tangent Lines and Rates of Change](https://tutorial.math.lamar.edu/Classes/CalcI/Tangents_Rates.aspx) – In this section we will introduce two problems that we will see time and again in this course : Rate of Change of a function and Tangent Lines to functions. Both of these problems will be used to introduce the concept of limits, although we won't formally give the definition or notation until the next section.

### [[Graphs and Limits]]

- [The Limit](https://tutorial.math.lamar.edu/Classes/CalcI/TheLimit.aspx) – In this section we will introduce the notation of the limit. We will also take a conceptual look at limits and try to get a grasp on just what they are and what they can tell us. We will be estimating the value of limits in this section to help us understand what they tell us. We will actually start computing limits in a couple of sections.

### [[When Limits Fail to Exist]]

- [One-Sided Limits](https://tutorial.math.lamar.edu/Classes/CalcI/OneSidedLimits.aspx) – In this section we will introduce the concept of one-sided limits. We will discuss the differences between one-sided limits and limits as well as how they are related to each other.
- [Infinite Limits](https://tutorial.math.lamar.edu/Classes/CalcI/InfiniteLimits.aspx)
    

### [[Limit Laws]]

- [Limit Properties](https://tutorial.math.lamar.edu/Classes/CalcI/LimitsProperties.aspx)
    

### [[The Squeeze Theorem]]

- [Computing Limits](https://tutorial.math.lamar.edu/Classes/CalcI/ComputingLimits.aspx)
    

### [[Limits using Algebraic Tricks]]

- [Computing Limits](https://tutorial.math.lamar.edu/Classes/CalcI/ComputingLimits.aspx)
    

### [[When the Limit of the Denominator is 0]]

- [Infinite Limits](https://tutorial.math.lamar.edu/Classes/CalcI/InfiniteLimits.aspx)
    

### [[Lines Graphs and Equations]]

- [Functions](https://tutorial.math.lamar.edu/Classes/CalcI/Functions.aspx)
    

### [[Rational Functions and Graphs]]

- [Common Graphs](https://tutorial.math.lamar.edu/Classes/CalcI/CommonGraphs.aspx)
    

### [[2.6.1 Limit at Infinity and Graphs]]

### [[2.5 Continuity on interval and continuous function]]

- [Continuity](https://tutorial.math.lamar.edu/Classes/CalcI/Continuity.aspx)
    

### [[2.5.2 Intermediate Value Theorem]]

- [Continuity](https://tutorial.math.lamar.edu/Classes/CalcI/Continuity.aspx)
