what is continuous ?  
when a limit approaching something what do we say from that ?
(b,c] 
[b,c)
$[b, \infty)$
continuous on the open end point of the interval and left right continuous on the close end point of the interval ? what does this mean does it mean that for open end point there need to be one continuous either in the left to right direction ? or does it mean that for close end point it need to be continuous on both side ?
what is a domain ? 

what is  sin cos cotan actually and why do we need to convert it into radian  ? 
you don't understand shifting in general what is shifted  to the right shifted to the left and so on ? 


In this case the range requires a little bit of work. From an Algebra class we know that the graph of this will be a [parabola](https://tutorial.math.lamar.edu/Classes/Alg/Parabolas.aspx) that opens down (because the coefficient of the x2 is negative) and so the vertex will be the highest point on the graph. If we know the vertex we can then get the range. The vertex is then,  

why is the range dependent on the vertex and vice versal 

how do you find the point of the vertex ? 

[[Properties of Trig Function pf sin and cos]] what does w have to do with anything, like I know that period when added is when the circle reset but what is the fix variable w doing ?  


[[Section 1.3  Trig Functions]]  why is it that the degree or the space between the degree is so different when moving up or down by pi like $\frac{2\pi}{3}$ have space smaller reaching $\frac{\pi}{3}$ when compare to $-\frac{2\pi}{3}$ 

why is it call an event function  ? 
From this unit circle we can see that cos(7π6)=−√32and cos(−7π6)=−√32. In this case the cosine function is called an **even** function and so for ANY angle we have 


To find this angle for this problem all we need to do is use a little geometry. The angle in the first quadrant makes an angle of π6 with the positive x-axis, then so must the angle in the fourth quadrant. So, we have two options. We could use −π6, but again, it’s more common to use positive angles. To get a positive angle all we need to do is use the fact that the angle is π6 with the positive x-axis (as noted above) and a positive angle will be t=2π−π6=11π6.
so what i don't
