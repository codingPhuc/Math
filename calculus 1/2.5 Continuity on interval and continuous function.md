we say that  a function f(x) is continuous on the interval (b,c) if 
f(x) is continuous at x = a for all a in (b , c)

f is continuous at x = a  for all  a in [b, c ]
- f is continuous right of b  
- f is continuous left of c 

how about half open  interval like : 
(b,c] 
[b,c)
$[b, \infty)$
continuous on the open end point of the interval and left right continuous on the close end point of the interval 
what infinity  is g(x) continuous  ?
