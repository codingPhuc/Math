$$
\begin{array}{l} 
(x + 3) (x+ 5)  (x + 7)(x + 9)   =  9   \\
(x^2  +8x + 15 ) (x^2 + 16x  + 63)  = 9  \\
x^4 +  16x^2   \\
 x^4 + 16x^3  + 504x + 15x^2 + 240x +  936   =  0  \\
\text{ divide the equation by } x^2   \\
x^2 + 16x +  \frac{504}{x} + 15 +  \frac{240}{x}  +  \frac{936}{x^2}   =   0   
\end{array}
