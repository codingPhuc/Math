there are many way of solving equation either by : 
1. factoring the equation 
2. by quadratic formula 
3. Square root method 


$$
\begin{array}{l}  \\
(3x -1)^2 = 12  \\
\left\{ \begin{array}{l}  \\
3x  - 1  = 2\sqrt{ 3 }   \\
3x   - 1  =  -2 \sqrt{ 3 }
\end{array}  \right.  \\
\left\{ \begin{array}{l}  
x   = \frac{2\sqrt{ 3 }  + 1}{3}  \\
x   = \frac{ -2 \sqrt{ 3 } +1}{3}
\end{array}  \right. 
\end{array}
$$


$$
\begin{array}{l} \\
2\sqrt{  x + 4 }  =  x - 3   \\
4x + 16  = x^2  -6x +   9   \\
x^2  -10x - 7  = 0   \\
\text{ used the quadratic equation}  \\
x =  5 + 4\sqrt{ 2 }   \\
x  = 5  - 4\sqrt{ 2 }  \\
\text{ however  plug in } 5-4\sqrt{ 2 }  \\
2\sqrt{ 5 -  4\sqrt{ 2 }  + 4 } \neq 5 - 4\sqrt{ 2 } -3   \\
\implies \text{ only got 1 answer } 5 + 4\sqrt{ 2 }
\end{array}
$$

if you have square of square root double check your answer

given $y= x^2 - x + 6$ 
1. find the x intercept  by plugging in 0 for y 
2. find the y intercept by plugging in 0 for x 
3. draw the chart by plugging in a range of x numbers resulting in y value then connect the point to draw the parabola
