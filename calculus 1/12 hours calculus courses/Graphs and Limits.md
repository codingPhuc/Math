## Graphs and limits 

example :  julia suice  18:55 

write a n equation y =F(x ) as a piecewise definition function 

$$
\{\begin{array} 
  0  \text{if } x  = 1  \\
10x \text{ if} x  \neq 1
\end{array}
$$
describe the behavior of  f(x ) when x is near 1 but is not equal to one 
describe the behavior of f(x) when x is near 1 but not equal to 1 


for real number a and L  ,  

not equal    $\lim_{ n \to 1 } \neq f(1)=10$ 
defintion for real number a and 


let say that the limit only care for the value that approach the desire value in this case a from both side the of  x axis  






## Descibe the behavior of $y=g(x )$  when x is near 2 

$$
\lim_{  x \to 2   } g(x) Dne   
$$


the picutre describe how the limit does not continue after the value  2 but cut of 

in the left side of the limit  
$$
\lim_{ n \to 2 }  =  1  
$$
right side of limit 
$$
\lim_{ n \to 2^+ }  = 3
$$



this section about how the direction of the limit affect the result of the function if the limit approaching 2  from either direction causing the function values to be negative then we say that the limit is a - . On the other hand, if the limit cause the function to be positive value then we say that it have a  + notation in the above 

the image here is saying that the limit approaching from left to right cause the F val to be pos  while the other cause the f val to be neg 


## last example 

look at the graph when x is negative 2  
y value is large larger than any real val we can choose right to left approach infi 
if the left to  right then it is  -  
the limit in the right and left does not exit since it does not hit -2 


- introduce the idea of limt 
- infinite limit 
- one sided limit 




	## for the function f(x) graphed below 

what is 
$$
\lim_{ x \to -1^- }   f(x ) = \frac{1}{2}
$$
 $$
\lim_{ x \to -1^+ }  f(x)  = 1  
$$
$$
\lim_{ n \to -1 }  DDne  
$$
this section talk about 

## note way that limit cannot exit 

1. limit from the left != limit from the right 

2 vertical asystopter 


3 special cases wild behavior 
why is $$
\lim_{ x \to 0 } \sin \frac{\pi}{x} 
$$
when it is appoarching 0 it create multiple different value do to all the real number in between cannot settle in on number causing the limit does not exit
