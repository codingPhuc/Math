#todo 
what is continuous ?  
when a limit approaching something what do we say from that ?
(b,c] 
[b,c)
$[b, \infty)$
continuous on the open end point of the interval and left right continuous on the close end point of the interval ? what does this mean does it mean that for open end point there need to be one continuous either in the left to right direction ? or does it mean that for close end point it need to be continuous on both side ?
what is a domain ? 

what is  sin cos cotan actually and why do we need to convert it into radian  ? 
you don't understand shifting in general what is shifted  to the right shifted to the left and so on ?
