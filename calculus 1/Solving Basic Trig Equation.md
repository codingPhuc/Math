for the equation 2cos(x) + 1 =0 
find the solution in the interval $[0,2\pi)$ 
$$
\begin{array}{l}  \\
f(x) = 2\cos(x)  = -1    \\
\cos(x) =   -\frac{1}{2}
\end{array}
$$

as we can see there are two solution for $f(x)$ where the x coordinate is  $-\frac{1}{2}$  
where x variable for the equation  cos(x)  is either  $\frac{2\pi}{3} \frac{,4\pi}{3}$ 
bases on this we can conclude the general form for the equation 

$$
\left\{\begin{array}{l}  
\frac{2\pi}{3}  + 2\pi \cdot k  \\
\frac{4\pi}{3} +  2\pi \cdot k     
\end{array}  \right. \xrightarrow{\text{}}  \text{ for any int k}

$$

do the same for the equation  $2\tan(x)   = 3\sqrt{ 3 } - \tan(x)$ 

find the solution in the interval  $[0,2\pi]$

$$
 \begin{array}{l} \\
3 \tan x  =  \sqrt{ 3  }   \\
\tan x  =  \frac{\sqrt{ 3 }}{3}
\end{array}
$$
