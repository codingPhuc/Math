Here’s a summary of the top suggestions from the discussion on learning Linear Algebra for Machine Learning:

### **Video Resources**

1. **Gilbert Strang’s MIT OpenCourseWare Lectures** – Highly recommended for clear explanations. Pairing the lectures with his book may help.
2. **3Blue1Brown's Linear Algebra Playlist** – Great for building intuition through visual explanations.

### **Books**

3. **Gilbert Strang’s Books** – _Introduction to Linear Algebra_ and _Linear Algebra and Learning from Data_ are popular, but some find them difficult at first.
4. **Linear Algebra: Step by Step (Kuldeep Singh)** – Step-by-step problem-solving approach.
5. **Introduction to Linear and Matrix Algebra (Nathaniel Johnston)** – Another recommended alternative.
6. **Linear Algebra by Friedberg, Insel, and Spence** – More rigorous but a solid option.

### **Courses & Exercises**

7. **DeepLearning.AI’s Mathematics for Machine Learning Course** – Focused on ML applications.
8. **edX Course (LAFF: Linear Algebra Foundations to Frontiers - UT Austin)** – Includes programming assignments.
9. **Practice Problem Solving** – Actively solving exercises is essential for mastery.
