1. read carefully 
2. draw  a picture ( if a pplicable)
3. find a formula( if you can )
4. verbal  model (like equation but with word)
5. fill in verbal model with variable but used just one variable 
6. solve and interpret back to original problem
ex you are on a building 225 tall. obviously you want to throw something at the people below  you throw  a water melon  if height  of water melon is given by  
$h(T ) = -16T^2+225$ , for T sec how long will it take water melon to hit ground ? 
![[6.7 Word Problem 2025-02-05 08.17.07.excalidraw]] 
we need to solve for T when it hit the ground  , 
if the height is 0 
$0= -16t^2 +225$ 
thing of the  height is 0 then we will solve for when the water melon hit 0 

$$ 

\begin{aligned}
-16t^2 +225 =0 \\ & -(16t^2-225) = 0 \\& 
\\ & 16t^2-225 = 0\\& 
(4t-25)(4t+25) = 0   \\&  
t=  \frac{25}{4}   , t  = \frac{-25}{4}
\end{aligned} 
$$
since there is no concept iof negative time when the  water melon hit zero the the correct answer will be $\frac{25}{4}$


the  square of a number minus the  twice the number is 63  
Ex: The square of a number minus twice number **is** 
- IS  here is a verbal 
- square of is the power 2 
- a number is x 
- minus is - 
- twice is 2 
- the number is x 
$$  
\begin{aligned}
x^2  - 2x =  63  \\ &  x^2  - 2x - 63  =  0  \\ &  (x-9)(x+7)  =  0  \\ & x  = 9   ,  x=  -7   
\end{aligned}
  
$$
translating the verbal model is what equal stand for an equation  

the length of a rectangle is  5 feet  more than the width . the area is 176 feet  
find length  &  width 
$$
\begin{aligned}
 5x =  y    \\ & 
x. y  =  176
\end{aligned}
  $$


![[6.7 Word Problem 2025-02-05 09.00.34.excalidraw]] 
A =  L . W  
176 = (x + 5) x  
$$
\begin{aligned}
176 = (x + 5) x     \\ & 
 (x + 5) x   - 176 = 0   \\ &  
 x^2 + 5x   - 176 = 0  \\ &   
(x-11)(x+16) = 0  \\ &    
 \\ &    x=11  , x=-16
\end{aligned} 
  $$

since the length cannot be negative so the width is 11 and the length is 16 

I need a sail for my racing boat 
condition : 
1. triangular 
2. base must be 1 foot less than 3 times the height 
3. area must be 210 feet 
![[6.7 Word Problem 2025-02-05 09.10.17.excalidraw]]
$$
\begin{aligned}
220  =  \frac{1}{2} \cdot (3T - 1 ) \cdot T   \\ & 
 (3T - 1 ) \cdot T    =  420 \\ &  3T^2 - T  - 420    =  0
 \\ & (x - 12)(3x + 35)  =  0   \\ & x  = 12  ,  x = - \frac{35}{3}
\end{aligned}  
  $$
we cannot accept   a negative height so the answer is 12 
the height is 12 and the bases is 35 feet

ex :  find two consecutive odd integers  whose product is 23 time more than their sum  ,

$$
\begin{aligned}
x\cdot(x+2)=x+x+2 +23 \\ & 
 x^2   + 2x  - x -x  -2 -23=0  \\ &   x^2     -25 =0   
 \\ & (x +  5)(x  - 5 )  =  0   \\ & x  = 5  ,  x = - 5
\end{aligned}  
  $$
we cannot accept   a negative height so the answer is 5
