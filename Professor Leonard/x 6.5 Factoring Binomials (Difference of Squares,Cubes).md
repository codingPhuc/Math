faster method for  factoring  binomial 
$$
\begin{array}{l} \\
15x^2  - 16x - 7  \\
=(3x - 1 ) (5x + 7)
\end{array}

# Different of Square 

there nee to be a minus sign for every Square 
$a^2  - b^2 = (a+b)  (a-b)$  it happened every single time  

Different of Cube :  $a^3  = b^3 = (a-b) (a^2 + ab + b^2)$ 
Sum of Cube :  $a^3  = b^3 = (a+b) (a^2 -  ab + b^2)$  
- the sum of cube and the different of cube have different sign  in the first and second parentheses  
## list of thing to look out for when factoring polynomials 
1. are the terms in order 
2. is the first terms positive 
3. is there a GCF 
4. then count the number of terms 
$a^2  - b^2 = (a+b)  (a-b)$   
Exercise : 
$x^2  - 16 =  x^2 - 4^2 = (x- 4)  (x + 4)$ 
1. yes 
2. yes  
3. no  
4. the numbers of terms is 2 
$y^2  + 64  \neq$ 
1. no  
2. yes  
3. no  
4. the numbers of terms is 2 
$\to$  there  is no way to do the diamond problem 
$y^2  - \frac{25}{81} = y^2   -  \left(  \frac{5}{9} \right)^2 = (y- \frac{5}{9} )  (y+ \frac{5}{9})$ 
1. yes 
2. yes  
3. no  
4. the numbers of terms is 2 
$9y^3-25y =  y(9y^2-25)  =  y(3y-5)(3y+5)$  
1. yes 
2. yes  
3. yes 
4. the numbers of terms is 2 
$80y^4-5 =  5(16y^4 - 1  )  =  5(4y^2-1)(4y^2+1)$    
1. yes 
2. yes  
3. yes 
4. the numbers of terms is 2
