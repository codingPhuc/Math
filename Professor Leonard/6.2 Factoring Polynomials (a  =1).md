# How to 
you have three terms 
$ax^2  + bx + c$   
the coefficient still exits event if there is no number 
$x^2 +4x + 3$ 
a= 1 
b =4 
c= 3 

the diamond  method 
![[6.2 Factoring Polynomials (a  =1) 2025-02-06 12.30.00.excalidraw]]
factoring create parentheses  $(x+1) (x+3)$ 
each time you see a three  term  polynomial it the diamond problem 

$x^4 +10x^2 + 21$  = $x^4 + 3x^2 + 7x^2 + 21$ = $x^2(x^2+3) +7(x^2+3)$ =  $(x^2+7)(x^2+3)$


$31  - 31z + z^2=z^2-31=(z-30)(z-1)$  

$x^2 -10xy - 3xy + 30y^2 = x(x-10y)-3y(x-10y)=(x -3y)(x-10y)$
you cannot factor it is a prime polynomial   
$y^2  + 6y  + 15$ 


what is the thing to check for if the first term polynomial 
- is it in order 
- is the first term positive  (help you to identify if you factor out a negative )
- factor out the GCF 
- then used the diamond method to factor and simplify even future 
$5x^5 - 25x^4 - 30x^3$ =  $5x^3[x^2 - 5x - 6]$ =   $5x^3(x-6)(x+1)$
