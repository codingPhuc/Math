Rectangular coordinate system  
(0,0) is the  origin  
System

pic 1  
the  orgin or the x or y axis 
you can add decimal number in there 
quardin and graphing point 




you know liner equation  
mean a straight line  
equation on a graph that will create a straight line  
7x- 2y =  4  this is the standard form  two variable  to make sure we can cordinate with both of them  to create a straight line 
Ax +  By  = C   
ex  :  Y = 2x  + 3    Ax +  By  = C 
linear equation is staight line   
to see if they are straight or  a europe line or tea table 
pic 2  
you want to find out what  x = 0 is because x = 0 let us know y more advance curve  we need to used both side meaning -1 and 1 
point that is not a straight  line is math error  
where  the graph cross the  y axis it is call the y  intercept  and where it cross the x-axis  is the x-intercept 
to find Y-INT  SET X =  0  
to find X-INT SET Y=0    

$Y = \frac{1}{2}X$
thing about the  direction of the line , the equation  will give a  line that will start in the west south to the east north

this is a horizontal line

vertical line
