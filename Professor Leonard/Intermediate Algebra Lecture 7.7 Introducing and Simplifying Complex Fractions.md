Complex fractions 
Ex :  
$$
\begin{array}{l}
\frac{\frac{5x}{x  + 2}}{\frac{10}{x-2}}  \\

\end{array} 
$$

not suck a great thing for faction on faction  , what is the main faction bar main thing going across 

Ex :  
$$
\begin{array}{l}
\frac{\frac{3x}{25y^2}}{\frac{9x^2}{5y}}  \\

\end{array} 
$$
STEPS  :  
1. SIMPLIFY SO THE NUMERATOR AND DENOMINATOR HAVE 1 FACTIONS  
2.
