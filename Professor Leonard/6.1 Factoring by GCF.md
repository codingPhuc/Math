# #definition 
Factor : Two or more or variable s that are multiplied to create a  term  



# Finding the greatest common  factors 
1. Common Factor  
	Example : 
	- 12 :  (**1**,12)  ,(**2**,6) , (3,**4**)  
	- 28 : (**1**,28) , (**2**,14) , (**4**, 7) 
	are factor that appear the most in two or more variables 
	Example : 
	- $12x^2:1,2,3,4,6,12,x,x^2$
	- $15x^4:1,3,5,15,x,x^2,x^3,x^4$ 
2. Greatest Common factors (Biggest Shared Factors)
	so in the first equation the greatest common factor is  4 
	in the second equation the greatest common factors is $3x^2$ 

# #Practice_Exercise  

find the GCF  of : $-18y^{2},-63y^{3},27y^{4}$ 
1. start with the lowest number in the equations 
	-$18x^2$ :(1,18) ,(9,2) ,$y^2$
2. here we see that  9 is divided by 63 and 27 
3. so the GCF is $9y^2$ 
$49x -  35 = 7(7x-5)$ this used the [[Factoring  Polynomials#greatest common factor]]  7 
 find the GCF of :   $5x^2y^4(2n+n)-(2n+n)$  
4. we can see that the right and left equation separated by a negative sign  
5. we can see there is a common factor (2n+n) 
6. se we will factor out (2n+n) in the term we will get 
	$(2n+n)(5x^2y^4-1)$
find the GCF of :  $xy + 2x + 3y +6$ 
7. first we will get rid of the common factor on the two equation from the left and right 
	$x(y+2)+3(y+2)$
8. then we will put the common factor (y + 2 ) out of the term 
	$(y+2)+(x+3)$
find the GCF of :  $3a^2 +4ab +3a+4b$ 
9.  first we will switch the position of 4ab and 3a 
	$3a^2+3a +4ab +4b$  
10. then we will get rid of the common factor on the two equation from the left and right  
	$3a(a + 1) + 4b(a+1)$  
11. then we will  put the (a+1 ) out of the term 
	$(a+1)(3a + 4b)$
