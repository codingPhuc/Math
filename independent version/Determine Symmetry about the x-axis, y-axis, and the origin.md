Determine if thegraphs of the equation would be symmetrical about the x-axis , y-axis , or the origin 


$$
y = -x^4  + 4x^2  + 5 
$$
x-axis 

$$
 - y_{1} = -x^4  + 4x^2  + 5 
$$
since the sign  on negative  $y_{1}$ does not  match the sign in  $y$ . We concluded that  the equation is not equivalent on the x axis 

y-axis 
$$
  y_{2} =  -  (-x)^4  + 4(-x)^2  + 5   =  -x^4  + 4x^2  + 5 
$$
since the sign on both part of the equation in $y_{2}$  match the sign in the equation y . We concluded that the equation in symmetric on the y axis 

origin 

$$
 -  y_{2} =  -  (-x)^4  + 4(-x)^2  + 5   =  -x^4  + 4x^2  + 5
$$
since the sign on the $y_{2}$ does not match   y
