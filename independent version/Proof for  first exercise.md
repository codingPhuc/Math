**Strictly speaking, there is a distinction between a function f , and its value f(x) at a point x. f is a function; but f(x) is a number (which depends on some free variable x). This distinction is rather subtle and we will not stress it too much, but there are times when one has to distinguish between the two. For instance, if f : R → R is the function f(x) := x2, and g := f |[1,2] is the restriction of f to the interval [1, 2], then f and g both perform the operation of squaring, i.e., f(x) = x2**

**and g(x) = x2, but the two functions f and g are not considered the same function, f = g, because they have different domains. Despite this distinction, we shall often be careless, and say things like “consider the function x2 + 2x + 3” when really we should be saying “consider the function f : R → R defined by f(x) := x2 + 2x+ 3”. (This distinction makes more of a difference when we start doing things like differentiation.** **pages 218-219** 

Tao define  a f(x) to be different  from g(x) as they have different domains 
e.g 
define  f(x) where x $\in$ R :  
f is R $\xrightarrow{\text{}}$ R  but different from g(x) even if both g(x) and f(x) has X $\in$  R and both equal to g(x), $f(x) =x^2 +x -1$
have f  =$R\xrightarrow{\text{} }R$ but different from g(x) even if both g(x) and f(x) has  $X\in R$ and both equal to g(x), f(x) = $x^2+x-1$
have f = $R\xrightarrow{\text{}}R$, f(x) where x $\in$ R, $f(x)=x^2 + x -1$
and g  = $R\xrightarrow{\text{}}R$, g(x) where  $x\in R$, $g(x) =x^2+ x-1$ 
$g(x)\neq f(x)$ because of x of either function g(x) and f(x) have 
$\left\{ x : x \in R f(x) > 0 V g( x) >3 \right\}$ because of this they show they have different domains 



Tao uses  this basic point wise operation ton functions : i.e defining  what you do to f, g you do to their values x.
setup : 
let $X\subset R$, a real valued function X whe
