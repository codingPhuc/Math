The notation `f: R → R` is used to define a **function**, specifying its **domain** and **range**.

Here's what it means:

- **`f`**: This is the **name of the function**.
- **`:`**: This colon separates the function's name from its domain and range specification.
- **`R` (first occurrence)**: This indicates that the **domain** of the function `f` is the set of **real numbers**. The domain (X) is the set of all possible "inputs" for the function. In the context of `f: X → Y`, `X` is the domain.
- **`→`**: This arrow signifies that the function "maps" or "assigns" elements from its domain to elements in its range.
- **`R` (second occurrence)**: This indicates that the **range** (or codomain) of the function `f` is also the set of **real numbers**. The range (Y) is the set where the "outputs" of the function are found.

Therefore, `f: R → R` means that `f` is a function that **takes any real number as an input** (from its domain `R`) and **produces a real number as an output** (which lies within its range `R`).

The sources emphasize that the domain and range are crucial to a function's identity:

- **Function definition**: A function `f: X → Y` from one set `X` to another set `Y` is an operation that assigns to each element `x` in `X` a single element `f(x)` in `Y`.
- **Explicit vs. Implicit Definition**: Functions can be defined explicitly by specifying their domain, range, and how the output `f(x)` is generated from `x`. For example, a function `f` with domain and range `N` (natural numbers) could be defined as `f(x) := x++` (the increment function).
- **Importance of Domain and Range**: While sometimes the domain and range are omitted for brevity, it is often important to know them. As discussed in our previous conversation, two functions with the same mathematical expression are considered different if they have different domains or ranges. For instance, `f(x) = x^2` defined on `R` is a different function from `g(x) = x^2` defined on the interval ``, even though they perform the same squaring operation, because they have different domains.

In summary, `f: R → R` precisely states that you are dealing with a function named `f` whose inputs must be real numbers and whose outputs will also be real numbers.\

- you should used subset when it describing a set of element like $X \subset R$





Absolutely! Let’s extract the **core logic and structure** from your text so you can write any function equality/inequality proof in a clean, organized way. I’ll focus on **Tao’s pointwise method and domain considerations** and give you a **template you can use**.

---

# **Structure for Writing Function Equality/Inequality Proofs (Tao style)**

---

### **Step 1: Define the functions clearly**

- Specify **domain** and **codomain** for each function.
    
- Write their formulas explicitly.
    

**Template:**

```markdown
Let 
$$
f: X \to Y, \quad f(x) = ...
$$
$$
g: X \to Y, \quad g(x) = ...
$$
```

**Example:**

```markdown
f: R → R, f(x) = x^2 + 2x - 1  
g: R → R, g(x) = (x+1)^2
```

---

### **Step 2: Recall the definition of equality**

- State the formal definition:
    

f=g  ⟺  same domain, same codomain, and f(x)=g(x)  ∀x∈Xf = g \iff \text{same domain, same codomain, and } f(x) = g(x) \; \forall x \in X

---

### **Step 3: Check pointwise equality**

- Compare outputs for **every x in the domain**.
    
- Consider if equality depends on a **restricted domain**.
    

**Template:**

```markdown
For each x ∈ X:  
f(x) = ...  
g(x) = ...  
Compare f(x) and g(x) pointwise.
```

**Example:**

```markdown
For x ∈ R:  
f(x) = x^2 + 2x - 1  
g(x) = (x + 1)^2  

Observe that f(x) = g(x) ∀ x ∈ R? Yes → f = g on R
```

---

### **Step 4: Check domain/codomain differences**

- Even if formulas match, **different domains mean functions are not equal**.
    
- Explicitly point out **domain restrictions** and their impact.
    

**Template:**

```markdown
Consider the domains:  
dom(f) = X  
dom(g) = D ⊆ X  

If D ≠ X, then f ≠ g, even if formulas are the same on D.
```

**Example:**

```markdown
f(x) = x, g(x) = |x|  
On X = [0, ∞), f(x) = g(x)  
On X = R, f(x) ≠ g(x) because f(x) ≠ g(x) for x < 0
```

---

### **Step 5: Pointwise operations (if needed)**

- If the proof involves sums, differences, products, quotients, or scalar multiples, define **pointwise operations**:
    

```markdown
(f + g)(x) = f(x) + g(x)  
(f - g)(x) = f(x) - g(x)  
(f ⋅ g)(x) = f(x)g(x)  
(f/g)(x) = f(x)/g(x), g(x) ≠ 0  
(c ⋅ f)(x) = c f(x), c ∈ R  
max(f,g)(x) = max{f(x), g(x)}  
min(f,g)(x) = min{f(x), g(x)}
```

---

### **Step 6: Conclude**

- Summarize your findings clearly:
    

```markdown
Conclusion:  
f = g on domain X   OR   f ≠ g because of domain difference or pointwise inequality.
```

---

### ✅ **Putting it all together (template)**

```markdown
1. Define functions:
   f: X → Y, f(x) = ...
   g: D → Y, g(x) = ...

2. Recall equality definition:
   f = g iff same domain, codomain, and f(x) = g(x) ∀ x ∈ X

3. Pointwise check:
   For each x ∈ X, compare f(x) and g(x)
   - If f(x) = g(x) ∀ x → pointwise equality holds
   - If f(x) ≠ g(x) for some x → inequality

4. Domain check:
   Compare dom(f) and dom(g)
   - If domains differ → f ≠ g

5. Optional: Pointwise operations
   Define (f + g)(x), (f - g)(x), etc.

6. Conclude:
   f = g OR f ≠ g with justification
```

If you want, I can **take your full text and rewrite it into a polished, Obsidian-ready proof** following this exact template, with all formulas in `$$ ... $$` so it’s clean and easy to read.

Do you want me to do that?



# what is a codomain 

Exactly — you’ve got the idea! Let me clarify it precisely and cleanly:

---

### **Codomain (Y)**

- The **codomain** is the set of values that the function is **declared or allowed to output** when you define it.
    
- Think of it as the **“target set”** for outputs.
    
- It doesn’t have to match what the function actually produces (that’s the **range**), but it **defines what outputs are possible in the function’s definition**.
    

**Notation example:**

f:X→Yf: X \to Y

- XX = domain (inputs)
    
- YY = codomain (allowed outputs)
    

**Example:**

- f:R→R,f(x)=x2f: \mathbb{R} \to \mathbb{R}, f(x) = x^2
    
    - Codomain Y=RY = \mathbb{R} (all real numbers are “allowed” as outputs)
        
    - Range = [0,∞)[0, \infty) (actual outputs)
        

---

✅ **Key point:**  
The codomain is part of the **definition of the function**. It tells anyone reading the function what type of outputs are possible — even if some values in the codomain are never actually reached by the function.

---

If you want, I can make a **tiny visual diagram for Obsidian** showing **domain → function → codomain**, with the range highlighted, so it’s super clear and you can always reference it when writing proofs.

Do you want me to do that? 


In the context of mathematics, particularly as presented in the sources, a **lemma** is a type of mathematical claim.

Here's a breakdown of what a lemma is:

- **A Claim to be Proved** From a logical standpoint, a lemma is essentially a statement that requires proof, just like a proposition, theorem, or corollary.
- **Purpose and Importance** The distinction between these terms (lemma, proposition, theorem, corollary) is primarily to indicate their **different levels of importance and difficulty**.
- **Defining Characteristic** A lemma is specifically described as an **"easily proved claim"**.
- **Role in Proofs** Its main function is to be **"helpful for proving other propositions and theorems"**.
- **Intrinsic Interest** Typically, a lemma **"is usually not particularly interesting in its own right"**. It serves as a stepping stone or a supporting argument for more significant results.

In essence, a lemma is a minor proven result that paves the way for proving more substantial mathematical statements.


In math, the symbol **`:=`** means **“is defined as”**.

It’s used when you **introduce a new definition** or give a precise meaning to a symbol.

---

### Examples

- f(x):=x2+1f(x) := x^2 + 1  
    → This means: “We define the function f(x)f(x) to be x2+1x^2 + 1.”
    
- a:=b+ca := b + c  
    → This means: “Let aa be defined as b+cb + c.”
    

---

📌 **Key difference from ==:**

- == means two things are **equal**.
    
- :=:= means the left-hand side is being **defined** to mean the right-hand side.
    

Think of it like giving something a **name** or **setting a rule**.

---

Do you want me to also show you how :=:= differs from **≡ (identically equal)**, since they’re sometimes confused? 



You are asking for an example to further illustrate the meaning of the **supremum (least upper bound)** as "the smallest real number that is greater than or equal to all elements in this set."

Let's use an example directly from the sources:

Consider the set **E** defined as the **interval of real numbers from 0 to 1, inclusive**: **E := {x ∈ R : 0 ≤ x ≤ 1}**.

Here's how the concept of supremum applies to this set:

1. **Upper Bounds for E**:
    
    - A **real number M is an upper bound for E if x ≤ M for every element x in E**.
    - For the set E = {x ∈ R : 0 ≤ x ≤ 1}, **1 is an upper bound** because every element of E is less than or equal to 1.
    - However, 1 is not the _only_ upper bound. For example, **2 is also an upper bound for E**, as is any number greater than or equal to 1.
    - A number like 0.5, on the other hand, is not an upper bound, because it is not larger than _every_ element in E (e.g., 0.5 is not larger than 0.7 or 1).
2. **The Supremum (Least Upper Bound) of E**:
    
    - The **supremum (least upper bound)** of E is an upper bound **M** such that **any other upper bound M' for E must be larger than or equal to M**.
    - For the set E = {x ∈ R : 0 ≤ x ≤ 1}, **1 is the least upper bound**.
    - While 2 is an upper bound, it's not the _least_ because 1 is also an upper bound and 1 < 2.
    - **1 fits the definition perfectly: it is an upper bound, and any other number that is an upper bound for E (e.g., 1.5, 2, 100) must be greater than or equal to 1**.

Therefore, for the set **E = {x ∈ R : 0 ≤ x ≤ 1}**, its supremum is **sup(E) = 1**. This is the **smallest real number that is greater than or equal to all elements in this set**.
