The user suggests a unique approach to learning math and computer science concepts by using college physics as an entry point. Here's a clear breakdown of their suggested learning path:

1. **Start with College Physics**
    
    - Use resources like Khan Academy to learn college-level physics.
    - Physics problems, particularly in mechanics, inherently use algebra, trigonometry, and vectors, making it a practical way to build mathematical foundations.
    - Pair this with creative programming resources like _Nature of Code_ videos to see how these concepts translate into programming.
2. **Progress to Math Topics via Physics**
    
    - Build confidence in math by solving physics problems.
    - This includes revisiting and strengthening algebra, trigonometry, and vector math.
3. **Learn Advanced Math Topics**
    
    - Once the basics are clear, move to:
        - **Calculus** – Start from the fundamentals.
        - **Statics** – Essential for understanding forces and structures.
        - **Discrete Math** – Focus on its foundational concepts, which are crucial for computer science.
4. **Dedicate 6 Months to 1 Year for Foundation Building**
    
    - If learning is consistent and effortful, it can take around 6 months to 1 year to grasp the foundational concepts.
5. **Explore Advanced and Specialized Topics**
    
    - After establishing the basics, transition to more complex and specialized areas like:
        - The math behind AI.
        - Databases.
        - Game engines.

### Why This Approach?

- It’s faster and more hands-on compared to a traditional college curriculum.
- Physics provides a contextual and applied understanding of math, making abstract concepts more relatable.
- Programming exercises solidify understanding by translating theory into practical applications.
