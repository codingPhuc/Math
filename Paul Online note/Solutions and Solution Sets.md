Show that each of the following numbers are solutions to the given equation or inequality.

$$
\begin{array}{l}
x =3  \; in \;  x^2   - 9   =  0  \\ \\
(x+ 3 ) (x-3 ) =  0   \\
\{\begin{array}\{
x =  -3   \\
x = + 3
\end{array}
\end{array}

 $$



$$
\begin{array}{l}
 x = 3  \;   in  \;  3(y +1 )   =  4y  -5   \\
3y  + 3    - 4y  +  5   = 0   \\

\end{array}
