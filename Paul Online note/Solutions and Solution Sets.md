# Show that each of the following numbers are solutions to the given equation or inequality.

$$
\begin{array}{l}
x =3  \; in \;  x^2   - 9   =  0  \\ \\
(x+ 3 ) (x-3 ) =  0   \\
\{\begin{array}\{
x =  -3   \\
x = + 3
\end{array}
\end{array}

 $$
We first plug the proposed solution into the equation.
 $$
 \begin{aligned}3^2-9&\overset{?}{\operatorname*{\operatorname*{=}}}0\\9-9&=0\\0&=0&\mathrm{OK}\end{aligned}
 $$
 
So, what we are asking here is does the right side equal the left side after we plug in the proposed solution. That is the meaning of the “?” above the equal sign in the first line.

Since the right side and the left side are the same we say that x=3x=3 **satisfies** the equation. 




$$
\begin{array}{l}
 x = 3  \;   in  \;  3(y +1 )   =  4y  -5   \\
3y  + 3    - 4y  +  5   = 0   \\
-y  + 8  = 0   \\
y  = 8  
\end{array}
$$ So, we want to see if y=8y=8 satisfies the equation. First plug the value into the equation.
$$
\begin{aligned}3\left(8+1\right)&\overset{?}{\operatorname*{\operatorname*{=}}}4\left(8\right)-5\\27&=27\quad\mathrm{OK}\\\\\end{aligned}$$
So, y=8y=8 satisfies the equation and so is a solution.




$$
\begin{array} {l}
z =1    \;  in \;   2(z - 5 )  \leq 4 \\
2z -10   \leq 4  \\
z  \leq  7 
\end{array}
$$

In this case we’ve got an inequality and in this case “satisfy” means something slightly different. In this case we will say that a number will satisfy the inequality if, after plugging it in, we get a true inequality as a result. 
Let’s check z=1.
$$
\begin{aligned}2\left(1-5\right)&\overset{?}{\operatorname*{\operatorname*{\operatorname*{\operatorname*{\leq}}}}}4\left(1\right)\\-8&\leq4\quad\mathrm{OK}\end{aligned}
$$

So, -8 is less than or equal to 4 (in fact it’s less than) and so we have a true inequality. Therefore z=1z=1 will satisfy the inequality and hence is a solution 



$$
\begin{array}{l}
z=-5 \; in \;  2(z-5) \leq  4z \\
2z - 10  \leq 4z  \\
z  \leq 7   
\end{array}
$$This is the same inequality with a different value so let’s check that.

$$
\begin{aligned}2\left(-5-5\right)&\overset{?}{\operatorname*{\operatorname*{\operatorname*{\operatorname*{\leq}}}}}4\left(-5\right)\\-20&\leq-20\quad\mathrm{OK}\end{aligned}
$$
In this case -20 is less than or equal to -20 (in this case it’s equal) and so again we get a true inequality and so z=−5z=−5 satisfies the inequality and so will be a solution.
