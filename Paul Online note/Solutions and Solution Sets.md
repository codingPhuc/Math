# Show that each of the following numbers are solutions to the given equation or inequality.

$$
\begin{array}{l}
x =3  \; in \;  x^2   - 9   =  0  \\ \\
(x+ 3 ) (x-3 ) =  0   \\
\{\begin{array}\{
x =  -3   \\
x = + 3
\end{array}
\end{array}

 $$
We first plug the proposed solution into the equation.
 $$
 \begin{aligned}3^2-9&\overset{?}{\operatorname*{\operatorname*{=}}}0\\9-9&=0\\0&=0&\mathrm{OK}\end{aligned}
 $$
 
So, what we are asking here is does the right side equal the left side after we plug in the proposed solution. That is the meaning of the “?” above the equal sign in the first line.

Since the right side and the left side are the same we say that x=3x=3 **satisfies** the equation. 




$$
\begin{array}{l}
 x = 3  \;   in  \;  3(y +1 )   =  4y  -5   \\
3y  + 3    - 4y  +  5   = 0   \\
-y  + 8  = 0   \\
y  = 8  
\end{array}
$$ So, we want to see if y=8y=8 satisfies the equation. First plug the value into the equation.
$$
\begin{aligned}3\left(8+1\right)&\overset{?}{\operatorname*{\operatorname*{=}}}4\left(8\right)-5\\27&=27\quad\mathrm{OK}\\\\\end{aligned}$$
So, y=8y=8 satisfies the equation and so is a solution.




$$
\begin{array} {l}
z =1    \;  in \;   2(z - 5 )  \leq 4 \\
2z -10   \leq 4  \\
z  \leq  7 
\end{array}
$$

In this case we’ve got an inequality and in this case “satisfy” means something slightly different. In this case we will say that a number will satisfy the inequality if, after plugging it in, we get a true inequality as a result. 
Let’s check z=1.
$$
\begin{aligned}2\left(1-5\right)&\overset{?}{\operatorname*{\operatorname*{\operatorname*{\operatorname*{\leq}}}}}4\left(1\right)\\-8&\leq4\quad\mathrm{OK}\end{aligned}
$$

So, -8 is less than or equal to 4 (in fact it’s less than) and so we have a true inequality. Therefore z=1z=1 will satisfy the inequality and hence is a solution 



$$
\begin{array}{l}
z=-5 \; in \;  2(z-5) \leq  4z \\
2z - 10  \leq 4z  \\
z  \leq 7   
\end{array}
$$This is the same inequality with a different value so let’s check that.

$$
\begin{aligned}2\left(-5-5\right)&\overset{?}{\operatorname*{\operatorname*{\operatorname*{\operatorname*{\leq}}}}}4\left(-5\right)\\-20&\leq-20\quad\mathrm{OK}\end{aligned}
$$
In this case -20 is less than or equal to -20 (in this case it’s equal) and so again we get a true inequality and so z=−5z=−5 satisfies the inequality and so will be a solution.



# Show that the following number aren't solution  to the given equation or inequality 
In this case we do essentially the same thing that we did in the previous example. Plug the number in and show that this time it doesn’t satisfy the equation. For equations that will mean that the right side of the equation will not equal the left side of the equation.
$$
\begin{array} {l}
y  =  -2  \;  in  \; 3(y+ 1)  = 4y-5  \\
3y +  3  = 4y - 5   \\
y = -8
\end{array} 
$$
$$
\begin{aligned}3\left(-2+1\right)&\overset{?}{\operatorname*{\operatorname*{\operatorname*{=}}}}4\left(-2\right)-5\\-3&\neq-13\mathrm{~NOT~OK}\end{aligned}

$$

So, -3 is not the same as -13 and so the equation isn’t satisfied. Therefore y=−2y=−2 isn’t a solution to the equation.



This time we’ve got an inequality. A number will not satisfy an inequality if we get an inequality that isn’t true after plugging the number in. 
$$

\begin{aligned}2\left(-12-5\right)&\overset{?}{\operatorname*{\operatorname*{\operatorname*{\operatorname*{\leq}}}}}4\left(-12\right)\\-34&\overset{\searrow}{\operatorname*{\operatorname*{\operatorname*{\operatorname*{\leq}}}}}-48\mathrm{~NOT~OK}\end{aligned}
$$



$$
\begin{array} {l}

z=  -12  \;  in  \;  2(z-5)  \leq  4z  \\
2z  - 10  \leq 4z   \\
z  \geq -5 
\end{array} 
$$
In this case -34 is NOT less than or equal to -48 and so the inequality isn’t satisfied. Therefore z=−12z=−12 is not a solution to the inequality.


# #definition  
now there is no reason to think that  the given equation and inequality will have only one solution . Look at the  $z   = 1   \;  in \;  2(z-5)  \leq  4z$  would at least have two solution . On the other hand , 
$x^2  - 9= 0$  you notice that there is two solution x = 3 and x = -3 

we call the complete set of solution the **solution set** for the equation and inequality . There is also some formal notation for the notation for the solution set although we won't be using it . Regradless we should still acknowledge it  


For equations we denote the solution set by enclosing all the solution is a set of braces , {} . For the equation above here are to two solution set 
$$
\begin{aligned}3\left(y+1\right)&=4y-5&&\text{Solution Set : }&\{8\}\\x^{2}-9&=0&&\text{Solution Set : }&\{-3,3\}\end{aligned}$$
For inequalities  we have similar notation . Depending on the complexity of the inequality the solution set may be a single number or it may be a range of numbers . If it is single number then we used the same notation for equations . If the solution set is a range of number   ,  as the  one we look above  is , we will used something called a set [builder notation](https://www.mathwords.com/s/set_builder_notation.htm) .  Here is the solution set for inequality we look above 
$$\{z|z\geq-5\}$$

This  is read as : "The  set of all z such  that z  is greater  than or equal  to   -5" 


Most of the inequalities that we that  we will look  at often have short hand solution set  that we often just short hand as  , 
$$x \geq -5$$

consider the following equation and inequation 
$$\begin{aligned}x^2+1&=0\\x^2&<0\end{aligned}$$
we know that squaring x will make x not be a negative number   for both of the equation . This cause the addition of 1 with the first equation be always number greater than 0 , in turn making it $x^2  +  1 \ne 0$  same go for the second equation there is no x square that is least then 0 


we need a way to denote the fact that there is not real solution here . In a solution set we call  a solution set empty and denote it a symbol : $\emptyset$   



In the above discussion of empty sets we assumed that we were only looking for real solutions. While that is what we will be doing for inequalities, we won’t be restricting ourselves to real solutions with equations. Once we get around to solving quadratic equations (which x2+1=0x2+1=0 is) we will allow solutions to be complex numbers and in the case looked at above there are complex solutions to x2+1=0x2+1=0. If you don’t know how to find these at this point that is fine we will be covering that material in a couple of sections. At this point just accept that x2+1=0x2+1=0 does have complex solutions.

Finally, as noted above we won’t be using the solution set notation much in this course. It is a nice notation and does have some use on occasion especially for complicated solutions. However, for the vast majority of the equations and inequalities that we will be looking at will have simple enough solution sets that it’s just easier to write down the solutions and let it go at that. Therefore, that is what we will not be using the notation for our solution sets. However, you should be aware of the notation and know what it means.
