The  tittle  of this exercise suggest   that we will be  solving  radicals equation . But for added challenge   we will be  presenting them as  a square root  .  Spare Root  cause the equation  to  be must more messier  
This is similar to section  [[Section 2.9  Equations Reducible to Quadratic in Form]]  . However  ,   even  though  the approach  may be the same,  the application need to  apply  differently
