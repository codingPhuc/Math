The  tittle  of this exercise suggest   that we will be  solving  radicals equation . But for added challenge   we will be  presenting them as  a square root  .  Spare Root  cause the equation  to  be must more messier  
This is similar to section  [[Section 2.9  Equations Reducible to Quadratic in Form]]  . However,  even though the approach may be the same ,  the application needs  to  be applied  differ  .
Here is an example 
$$
\begin{array}{l}
x =   \sqrt{ x +  6   }   \\

\end{array}
$$
