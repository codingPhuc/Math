# Definition  of Relation 
A **relation**  is  a set of order pairs 

This seem  like an odd definition ,  but we  need it for the definition  of a function( which is the main  topic of this section) .However, before the definition of a function  let see what a relationship actually is  
think  back to [[Section 3.1 Graphing#Practice_Exercise]] . In the  example we constructed a set of order  pairs to sketch the  graph of $y =(x - 1)^2 - 4$ 
$$
(−2,5)(−1,0)(0,−3)(1,−4)(2,−3)(3,0)(4,5) 
$$ here are the relation  that will form from the set of order pairs
