# Definition  of Relation 
A **relation**  is  a set of order pairs 

This seem  like an odd definition ,  but we  need it for the definition  of a function( which is the main  topic of this section) .However, before the definition of a function  let see what a relationship actually is  
think  back to [[Section 3.1 Graphing#Practice_Exercise]] . In the  example we constructed a set of order  pairs to sketch the  graph of $y =(x - 1)^2 - 4$ 
$$
(−2,5)(−1,0)(0,−3)(1,−4)(2,−3)(3,0)(4,5) 
$$ here are the relation  that will form from the set of order pairs 

There are of course many  relation  we could form from the list of order pairs  above , we just want to list a few possible relations to give some example .Note as well that we could get  any order pairs  from the relation and add those into the equation as well 

Why do  we need to used  relation ?  Because some relation  are special and are used in all level of math 

## Definition of a function 
A **function**  is a value , in which each value  from the  first  set of the order pairs is  associated with   exactly one value from the set of second components of the ordered pairs
