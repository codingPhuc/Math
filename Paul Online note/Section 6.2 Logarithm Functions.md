In this section we are going to move on to logarithm functions . This can be a tricky function to graph right  away  


if  b is any number  $b>0$ and  $b\neq 0$  and $x>0$ then 
$$
y = \log_{b}x  \text{ is equivalent to } b^y  = x  
$$
we read this as "log bases b of x"  
In this definition  $y=\log_{b}x$ is called the logarithm  form and  $b^y = x$ is called the exponential form 

Note that the requirement  $x>0$ is really the result of the fact that we
