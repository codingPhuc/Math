In this section we are going to move on to logarithm functions . This can be a tricky function to graph right  away  


if  b is any number  $b>0$ and  $b\neq 0$  and $x>0$ then 
$$
y = \log_{b}x  \text{ is equivalent to } b^y  = x  
$$
we read this as "log bases b of x"  
In this definition  $y=\log_{b}x$ is called the logarithm  form and  $b^y = x$ is called the exponential form 

Note that the requirement  $x>0$ is really the result of the fact that we also require $b>0$ . This is due to the fact that raising a negative bases to a non integer exponent like ($(-x)^{1/2}$) will result in a complex number  . Therefore , there will be a restriction put in place to make sure that the number stay in $\in R$ 




#note
	The log part is just to notify that we are dealing with a logarithm . They are not number and they are not signifying multiplication  
	The B in the $y=\log_{b}x$ equation  above does not mean that it $\log(b^x)$ but instead b is the base that is exponent by  some number y  to get x 

$$
\log_{4}16   = 2  
$$
$$
\log_{2}16  =  4
$$

$$
\log_{6}216  =  6^3  
$$

$$
\log_{5}{\frac{1}{125}}  =  -3
$$

$$
\log_{\frac{1}{3}}81 = -4  
$$
$$
\log_{\frac{3}{2}}{\frac{27}{8}}   =  3  
$$

With these logarithm in mind , there is also different type of logarithm  that occur in a regular basic . Here are the definition using these two logarithms  . 

$$
\begin{array}{l}
\text{ common  logarithm } \log_{x} = \log_{10}  x  \\
\text{ natural logarithm } \ln_{x}  = \log_{e}x \\
\end{array}
$$

so the common logarithm  is simply log base 10 with remove the 10 notation from the log . Similarly ,  natural logarithm is  e which we saw in the pervious section [[6.2 Factoring Polynomials (a  =1)]]

$$
\log{1000}
$$
$$
\log {\frac{1}{}}
$$
