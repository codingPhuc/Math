In this section we will now take a look at solving logarithm equation , equation with logarithm in them .  in particular  , we will be looking at which term is a logarithm and we will also look at equation in that all but one term in the equation is a logarithm and the term without the logarithm  is a constant 

Before we move on remember the constrain that we can only plug positive number into a logarithm . This will be important down the road 

$$
\text{ if } \log_{b}y  \text{  then  }  x =  y 
$$

if we've got two logs in the problem ,  one on either side of the equal with both a coefficient  of one and the same base . Then we can drop the logarithms 
## Solve each of the following equations.  
#fail 
$$
\begin{array}{l}
2 \log_{9}{\sqrt{ x }   }  - \log_{9}{(6x  -1 )}  = 0    \\
 \log_{9}{x }   =    \log_{9}{(6x  -1 )}       \\
x    =  6x  -1   \\
x  = \frac{1}{5}    \\
\end{array}
$$



$$
\begin{array}{l}
\log x   + \log (x  -1 )  =  \log (3x + 12)   \\
\log (x  -1 )x    =   \log (3x + 12)     \\
x( x  -1 )  =  3x + 12   \\

\end{array}
$$





$$
\begin{array}{l}
\log_{2}(x^2  - 6x)  =  3 +  \log_{2}(1 - x)    \\
\log_{2}(x^2  - 6x)  =  \log_{2}8 +  \log_{2}(1 - x)    \\
  \log_{2}(x^2  - 6x)  =  \log_{2}(8\cdot  (1 - x) )   \\
x^2  - 6x   =  8  -  8x    \\
x^2 +  2x    - 8   =  0   \\
\left\{  \\
 \begin{array}{l} 
x=  -4   \\
x =  2 \\
\end{array}
 \right.
\end{array}
