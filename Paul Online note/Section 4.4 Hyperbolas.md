the next graph we need to look at is the  hybebola .

Hyperbolas consist of two vaguely parabola shape pieces that open either up and down or left and right. just like a parabola each pieces have it own vertex . Note that these are not parabolas they just resemble them . 

There are also two line on each graph. These line are called asymptotes as the graph show as we make x large (in both the positive and negative sense) the graph of the hyperbolas get closer and closer to the asymptotes .However they are included to make sure we get the sketch correct . The point where the two asymptotes cross is called the hyperbola 

There are two standard form of the hyperbola , one for each directional type shown above 


| Property                     | Horizontal Hyperbola                                      | Vertical Hyperbola                                        |
|-----------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Standard Form**           | $$\frac{(x-h)^2}{a^2} - \frac{(y-k)^2}{b^2} = 1$$          | $$\frac{(y-k)^2}{b^2} - \frac{(x-h)^2}{a^2} = 1$$          |
| **Center**                  | $$(h, k)$$                                                 | $$(h, k)$$                                                 |
| **Opens**                   | Left and right                                             | Up and down                                                |
| **Vertices**                | $$(h+a, k), (h-a, k)$$                                     | $$(h, k+b), (h, k-b)$$                                     |
| **Slope of Asymptotes**     | $$\pm \frac{b}{a}$$                                        | $$\pm \frac{b}{a}$$                                        |
| **Equations of Asymptotes** | $$y = k \pm \frac{b}{a}(x - h)$$                           | $$y = k \pm \frac{b}{a}(x - h)$$                           |
