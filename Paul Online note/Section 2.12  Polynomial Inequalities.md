# #definition  
in this section we will be solving  (single )   inequalities that   involve   polynomials    of degree   at least two .  Or  to  put it in a different  perspective  the  polynomials   will not be linear any more  .  As a result , the process we  used  for solving  linear  inequalities  will not be applicable any more 


## step  for solving the  problem  
$$

\begin{array} {l}
x^2  -10   <   3x       \\
x^2    - 3x - 10   < 0     \\
(x -  5) (x +  2 ) <  0  \\
 \left\{
\begin{array}{l}
x -  5  <  0  \\
x +  2 < 0     \\

\end{array} \\
\implies
\left\{
\begin{array}{l}
x   <   5   \\
x  < -2  

\end{array}
\right.
\right. 
\end{array} 
$$



1. get  one zero  on one side of the inequality  ,   it does not  matter which side  is going to be zero   
$$x^2    - 3x - 10   < 0$$
2. if  possible  factor the  Polynomial   , this step  is really  here to simplify the process more than  anything  .     
$$(x -  5) (x +  2 ) <  0$$
3. Determine where the polynomial  is   0  ,  this does  not help   us  solve the equation however  since  know if something  like  0 <   0  is  not a  true  inequality   . However , it will  help  us  get to the right direction 
we  need to understand the the graph in  a  polynomial  function does not  have any break  in them ,  smooth and curve    .  This mean that  when ever the  function change sign  it must be  crossing  zero   

We have already found the crossing point dividing   each region   ,  by using the point we know that this  polynomial  is divided  into 3  region each with their own sign .  If a point exit  in one region  is  a negative sign  then  any other point  in that region will be negative and vice versa  .  So  if the inequality  is not satisfy  for a point in that region  then it is not satisfied for any point in that region

we can used test  point to test for  inequalities in   each region  , you should make these  test point  simple to plug in 
5. Write down the answer  , by  plugging in the point we can see that the middle region  satisfy the  inequality that is  desire for  our  problem . We conclude this  bases on the fact that when we plug in a  point  and it turn  out  lest  than  0   ,   so  if the inequality  is satisfy  for a point in that region  then it is  satisfied for any point in that region  .  As a result , the interval that we need to find is   $(-2 ,  5)$  



## practice example 
$$\begin{array}{l}
x^2    - 5x  \geq     -6  \\
x^2  - 5x   +  6  \geq   0   \\
(x -  6) (x +  1  ) \geq   0  \\
  \left\{
\begin{array}{l}
x -  5  =    0  \\
x +  2 =   0     \\

\end{array} \\
\implies
\left\{
\begin{array}{l}
x   <   5   \\
x  < -2  

\end{array}
\right.
\right.
\end{array}$$
