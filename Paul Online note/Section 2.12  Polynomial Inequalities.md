# #definition  
in this section we will be solving  (single )   inequalities that   involve   polynomials    of degree   at least two .  Or  to  put it in a different  perspective  the  polynomials   will not be linear any more  .  As a result , the process we  used  for solving  linear  inequalities  will not be applicable any more 


## step  for solving the  problem  
$$

\begin{array} {l}
x^2  -10   <   3x       \\
x^2    - 3x - 10   < 0     \\
(x -  5) (x +  2 ) <  0  \\
 \left\{
\begin{array}{l}
x -  5  <  0  \\
x +  2 < 0     \\

\end{array} \\
\implies
\left\{
\begin{array}{l}
x   <   5   \\
x  < -2  

\end{array}
\right.
\right. 
\end{array} 
$$



1. get  one zero  on one side of the inequality  ,   it does not  matter which side  is going to be zero   
$$x^2    - 3x - 10   < 0$$
2. if  possible  factor the  Polynomial   , this step  is really  here to simplify the process more than  anything  .     
$$(x -  5) (x +  2 ) <  0$$
3. Determine where 


so the interval  notation  of x  is   $( - \infty ,  -2]$
