we saw that there were some special  cases in the solution of the two system . We saw that there can be either no solution or infinite solution . In the following we are going to general systems of equations , we will look at how to used augmented matrix to deal with these cases 


## fact 
equations there are exactly three possibility for the solution 
1. thee
