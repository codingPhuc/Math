we will take a quick  look at circles .  Before that however  , we are going to  take a quick a look at circle 
Given  two  points   $(x_{1} ,  y_{1})$ and  $(x_{2} , y_{2})$ the distance between  them is given  
$$
dm  = \sqrt{(x_{2}   -  x_{1})^2   + (y_{2}  - y_{1})^2  }
$$
So why  is this  formula need  ,  recall that  a circle  is  just  all point of that have the same distance  ,  r is called the  radius o
