# #definition   
in this section we want to look at inequation that contain  absolute equation  

##  inequation  involving  <  and  dm$\leq$
we start at by  looking at a simple cases  
$\mid p \mid \leq 4$ 
this is saying that what ever  p  is   it much  not have distance of more than  4  from the origin   . This mean that  p  much  be somewhere in the range of  
$$
-4\leq p  \leq 4
$$
we could  get a similar    < and  get a similar result 
In general  ,  we have to following  formulas to use here ,  
$$
\boxed{\begin{array}{ll}\mathrm{If~}|p|\leq b,&b>0&\mathrm{~then~}-b\leq p\leq b\\\mathrm{If~}|p|<b,&b>0&\mathrm{~then~}-b<p<b\end{array}}
$$ this require  that   b will  be positive just like solving the equation of   [[Section 2.14 Absolute Value Equations]]

$$
\begin{array}{l}
\mid  2x -  4 \mid <  10   \\
-10<  2x  - 4  <  10    \\
-6  <  2x   <    14 \\
-3  <  x  <   7  
\end{array} 
$$
the interval  solution   is  $(-3,  7)$

$$
\begin{array}{l}
\mid 9m   +  2\mid <  1    \\
-1<   9m   +  2 <  1  \\
-3  <  9m     <    -1  \\
-\frac{3}{9}  <  m   <   7  
\end{array} 
$$
the interval  solution   is  $(-3,  7)$
