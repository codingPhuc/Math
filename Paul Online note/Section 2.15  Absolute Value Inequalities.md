# #definition   
in this section we want to look at inequation that contain  absolute equation  

##  inequation  involving  <  and  dm$\leq$
we start at by  looking at a simple cases  
$\mid p \mid \leq 4$ 
this is saying that what ever  p  is   it much  not have distance of more than  4  from the origin   .
