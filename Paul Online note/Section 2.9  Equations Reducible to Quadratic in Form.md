# #definition   
we going to  be look  at equation  that when  in  the correct light can turn  into quadratic  equation . 
$$
\begin{array}{l}
x^4   -  7x^2  +  12     \\
(x^2)^2   - (7x)^2  + 12    \\
u   =  x^2   \\
\implies  u^2   - 7u^2  + 12 =0   \\
( u  -3 ) ( u -4 )    \\
 \left\{
\begin{array}{l}
  u  =   3    \\
u  = 4   \\
 
\end{array} \\
\implies
\left\{
\begin{array}{l}
  x^2   =   3    \\
x^2  = 4   \\
 

\end{array}
\right. \\
\implies
\left\{
\begin{array}{l}
  x  = \pm  \sqrt{ 3 }    \\
x =  \pm 2   \\
 

\end{array}
\right.
\right.  
 \end{array}
$$
the basic process    is to chec
