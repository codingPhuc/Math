Now we need to discuss  about graphing functions . if we recall from the pervious section we said that $f(x)$ is nothing more than a fancy way of writing y .This mean that we already know how to graph functions . We graph function in exactly the same way we graph equations . If we know ahead of time what the function is a graph of , we can used that information to help us graph , and if we do not know what the function is ahead of time then all we need to do is to plug in some x to compute the value of the funciton (which is really a y value) then plot the point 

$$
\begin{array}{l}
f(x) =   (x - 1)^3 + 1 
\end{array}
