in this section we need to talk about the third method of solving systems of equations . 
For systems with two equation it is much more complicated when compare to the pervious section  , but for system with three or more equation it is easier 

we first need to get some definition out of the way . 

An augmented matrix for a system of equation is a matrix of number where each row represents the constant from one equation( both the coefficient  and constant on the other side of the equal sign) and each column represent all the coefficients for a single variable 




$$
\left[\begin{array}{ccc|c} 
1 & -2 & 3 & 7 \\
2 & 1 & 1 & 4 \\
-3 & 2 & -2 & -10
\end{array}\right]
$$

The first row show us all the constant numbers like the coefficient of x ,y z and the constant left of the equal sign on the left . Similarly , the same is true for the remaining row  . The dash line represent where the equal sign was originally 


Next we will discuss the elementary row operation  . There are three of them and we will give a notation used for each one
