let start the section  off with  a  quick  mathematical definition of  a line  .  Any equation that can be written  in the form  ,  
$$Ax +  By   =  C $$ 
is  a  line    ,  as long as   A  and  B  are  not  simultaneously   0 .  It is  okay if one of them  is  0  , we  just can't have  both as  0   . Note that this is sometime call the **standard form** of the line 

a  line  is define  by  two  point that are on the line .  Given  two  points that are on the line  we can graph the line   and write down the equation of the line . This fact will be used in serval  point  in the equation 

a **slope** in the line is the level of  steepness of  lines  and can be used too  measure  whether  a line is increasing  or decreasing as we move from  left to right  . Here are the definition of    a slop of a  line 

given  2  points  $(x_{1}  ,  y_{1}) \cap  (x_{2} ,  y_{2})$ the slope of the  given line is 
$$
 m = \frac{y_{2} - y_{1}}{x_{2} -y_{1}}
$$
In other words  the slope is the different in the y  values  divided by the different  in the x  value .  do  not worry about the   subscripts(define the different version of the variable ) on the  variable   

do  not worry  about which  point should  be first and which  point should be second  .  Because regardless of the order we can still  determine the different  of the slope

there is also  a  geometric  equation for the slope  and line  as well  . You will hear the slope and line define as follow 
$$
 m  = \frac{rise}{run}
$$
