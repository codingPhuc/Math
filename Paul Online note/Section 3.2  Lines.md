let start the section  off with  a  quick  mathematical definition of  a line  .  Any equation that can be written  in the form  ,  
$$Ax +  By   =  C $$ 
is  a  line    ,  as long as   A  and  B  are  not  simultaneously   0 .  It is  okay if one of them  is  0  , we  just can't have  both as  0   . Note that this is sometime call the standard form of the line
