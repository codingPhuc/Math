let start the section  off with  a  quick  mathematical definition of  a line  .  Any equation that can be written  in the form  ,  
$$Ax +  By   =  C $$ 
is  a  line    ,  as long as   A  and  B  are  not  simultaneously   0 .  It is  okay if one of them  is  0  , we  just can't have  both as  0   . Note that this is sometime call the **standard form** of the line 

a  line  is define  by  two  point that are on the line .  Given  two  points that are on the line  we can graph the line   and write down the equation of the line . This fact will be used in serval  point  in the equation 

a **slope** in the line is the level of  steepness of  lines  and can be used too  measure  whether  a line is increasing  or decreasing as we move from  left to right  . Here are
