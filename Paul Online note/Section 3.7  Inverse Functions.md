In the last example in the pervious section we look at two function , $f(x) =3x -  2$ and $g(x) =\frac{x}{3}+ \frac{2}{3}$ 
$$
\left(f\circ g\right)\left(x\right)=\left(g\circ f\right)\left(x\right)=x
$$
these are very special function  . Let see what make them so special . Consider the following evaluations   


$$
\begin{array}

\end{array}
f(-1) = 3(-1) -2  = -5  
$$
