A math proof is a type of argument that a mathematician uses to convince another mathematician of the truth of some fact about mathematics.

A proof starts with facts about mathematics that everyone agrees are true then shows how those ideas can be used to show that the other things must also be true.

One part of mathematics is called logic which is about establishing the rules of how true facts can be combined to create other facts.

Proofs can be formal where the proof starts with a list of the facts and every logical step is stepped though exactly. However you can have informal proofs that basically give the outline of how the proof works and skips over much of the busy work.

A proof starts with facts about mathematics that everyone agrees 


Mathematical proofs are structured arguments used to establish the truth of mathematical statements. They begin with accepted truths (axioms) and proceed logically to deduce new facts. Logic plays a fundamental role in ensuring the validity of these deductions.

Proofs can be **formal**, where every logical step is explicitly detailed, or **informal**, where only the outline is provided. Axioms are not necessarily "true" in an absolute sense; they function as foundational assumptions, much like rules in a game. Different mathematical systems can be built on different sets of axioms, leading to varying results.

There is debate over whether mathematics reflects some external reality or is purely a constructed system based on chosen axioms. Some mathematicians see axioms as arbitrary, while others argue that they reflect deeper truths. The **law of the excluded middle**, for example, is accepted in classical logic but rejected in intuitionistic logic.

A proof’s validity depends on whether each step follows logically from the previous ones. If a step is flawed, the proof is invalid. Once a proof is accepted, it becomes a foundation for further mathematical developments. Proofs ensure that mathematical results are reliable, making them essential for applications like programming, physics, and engineering. 


This means that proofs can be written in two different ways:

1. **Formal Proofs:**
    
    - Every step is explicitly written out using strict logical rules.
    - They follow a very structured approach, often using symbols and precise mathematical notation.
    - These are typically used in rigorous mathematical settings, such as in proof assistants or foundational studies in logic.
    - Example: A computer-verified proof would require each logical step to be formally justified.
2. **Informal Proofs:**
    
    - They provide a general outline of the reasoning without detailing every minor logical step.
    - Some obvious steps may be skipped to make the proof more readable and intuitive.
    - These are common in textbooks, research papers, and lectures where full formalization isn’t necessary.
    - Example: Instead of proving every arithmetic property used, a mathematician might simply state that a number is even and proceed without breaking it down further.

In short, formal proofs are highly detailed and precise, while informal proofs focus on conveying the main ideas without excessive technical details. 


There's a book called "Book of Proof" that's free online somewhere that intends to teach people how to write proofs.

As for what a proof is, I'll say how I as an undergrad look at them. In your math class, or read through of a textbook, you'll learn definitions and basic properties of math things. Then, there will be some result of these definitions that are not immediately obvious but they follow logically from the definitions and properties. A math proof just illustrates that logical path from the basics to the result.

For instance, a basic property of the integers is that x+0=x for all x in the integers (0 is called the additive identity). You probably know that x•0=0 for all x as well, but this isn't a basic property, it follows from the others. To prove this, you also need to know the distributive property" a(b+c)=ab+ac, and the additive inverse property: a +-a =0.

Claim: x•0=0 for all x in the integers. Proof: By additive identity, 0+0=0. Then multiplying on the left by a yields a(0+0)=a0. By distributivity, a0+a0=a0. By additive inverses we have a0+(a0+-a0)=a0+-a0, gives a0+0=0, which simplifies to a0=0. QED See how I justified each step using the properties we knew (albeit not perfectly)? That's what a proof is.

When you're actually trying to find the path from the claim to actually proving it, though, you pretty much just have a lot of information floating around in your head from class and maybe some assumptions of the problem will point you towards the properties you need to be looking at.

I hope you find this answer somewhat satisfying.
