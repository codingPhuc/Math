which  method should we used to solve  quadratic  equation .  If you  instructor  specify  a method then you should used that method .  However , if they do not determine  a  guideline  then you must do  so your  self   . Here  are step to determine  a guideline  
1. is it clear that it have  a square root  property  problem  ,  does it  only contain something  square and a constant .  If this is true then square root  property  is the easiest thing to used 
2. does it factor  ? then do  it .  Note that you should not spend a lot of time to determine if the  quadratic  equation  factor  . Look  at the equation then  if you determine  that it factor then go with it   
3. if you reach this point then you have determined  that the equation  is not in the correct form  for square root  property and that it does not factor so your only choice is to used the quadratic equation 
Note how there are not completing the square  , this is because it is  a long process  and you should used quadratic equation instead 

## analysis
Let analyze   what we saw in the pervious  section :  
$$ax^2     + bx  + c  =   0 $$ we will get one of the following solution  :  
1. Two real distinct   solution 
2. A double root.  Recall that this  arises  when we can factor the equation   into  a perfect square 
3. Two complex  solutions 
These  are only  possible for  quadratic  equation in standard form  .  Note  however ,   that if we start  with rational  expression in the equation we will get different solution set  ,  because we want to avoid   one of the solution so that we will not division by 0   
We can  also  find out before hand , what type of cases  we will get by looking at  quadratic equation(in standard form) 

$$   x  =    \frac{ -  b   \pm  \sqrt{ b^2 - 4ac   }     }{2a}      $$
The  quantity  $b^2   - 4ac$   in the quadratic formula  is called discriminant  .  It  is the value of the discriminant that will determine  which solution   set we will see  
1.  Two real  distinct solution  . We will get this solution  set if   $b^2   - 4ac$   i > 0   ,so the numerator for the above  formula  will be  minus b   plus minus a real number  . As a result , the numerator will be a  real number  , dividing by one or two would not change the fact that they are real  , nor will it change the fact that they are different 
2. A double root .  we will get this result if     $b^2   - 4ac$   i  =  0  . Here we will take the square root of  0   which is  0  , so   only  -b  remain  but since there are no plus and  minus part . We will get a single real number 
3. Two complex solution .  We will get this solution set if   $b^2   - 4ac$   i < 0 .  If the discriminant is negative we will be  taking  the square root of a   negative number  in the quadratic solution   resulting in a complex number . Also we will get two different number since they have a plus or minus 
 - **$b^2   - 4ac$   i > 0**  
- **$b^2   - 4ac$   i  =  0**   
-  **$b^2   - 4ac$   i < 0** 

$$13x^2     + 1   =  5x  $$ using the   **$b^2   - 4ac$   
$$ 25   -  4.13  =  -27 $$ so this   equation will have a complex number solution  because        **$b^2   - 4ac$    <   0 

$$6q^2+20q=3  $$

using     **$b^2   - 4ac$   
$$ 20  =  -27 $$
so this equation  will have a
