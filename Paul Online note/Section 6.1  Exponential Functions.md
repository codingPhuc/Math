this chapter start of with the definition of a exponential functions 

if b is any number such that $b>0$ and $b\neq 1$ then exponential function is a function in the form , 
$$
f(x)  = b^x 
$$
where b is called the base and x can be any real number 
Notice that the x is now in the exponent and the base is a fixed number. This is the opposite from what we have seen in this point .To  this point the base is a variable x and the exponent is a fix number. However despite the different these function evaluate in the same way those that we are used to . 

There is some constrains that we need to mention , we need to avoid the constant b being 0 or 1  

$$
f(x)  =   0^x  =  0  \text{ and } f(x)  = 1^x  = 1  
$$
Due to this these are called exponent function and do not have the properties that normal exponents function have 
The next constraint is prohibiting function that have the
