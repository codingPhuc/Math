A linear system with two variables is any system that can be written in the form of 
$$
\begin{array}{l}  
ax + by =  p    \\
cx  + dy  = q 
\end{array}
$$
where any constant can be zero with the exception that each equation must have at least one variable in it 
Also , the system is only linear  of the variables are only the first power ,are only numerator and there are no product of variable in any of the equation 
Here is an example of systems with numbers  
$$
\begin{array}{l}  
3x - y =  7  \\
2x + 3 y = 1  
\end{array}
$$


before solving the equation we must ask what the solution to a system of equation is . A solution to a system of equation is a value of x and a value of
