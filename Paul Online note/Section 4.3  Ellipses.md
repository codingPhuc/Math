# #definition 
In the pervious [[Section 3.3  Circles]] we look at graph and circle since circle are a special cases of ellipses we've already got most of the tools under our belt . All we really need to do to get us started is the standard form of ellipse and info about how to interpret it 

here is the standard form of ellipse 
$$
\frac{(x -  h)^2}{a^2} + \frac{(y  - k)^2} { b^2 }   = 1 
$$

Note that  the right side need to be exactly one in order for this too work 
just like with graphing a circle all we need to graph a ellipse is the right most top most bottom most and left most point . 
$$
\begin{array}{l} \\
\text{right most point} ( h + a , k) \\
\text{left most point} (h   -a  , k)
 \\
\text{top most point}( h , k + b)
 \\
\text{bottom most point}(h  , k -b )

\end{array}
$$
## Sketch the graph of each of the following ellipses.

$$
\begin{array}{l} \\
\frac{(x + 2)^2}{9}  +  \frac{( y - 4)^2 }{ 25}  =  1  \\

\end{array}
$$
$$
\begin{array}{l} \\
\text{right most point} ( h + a , k) \\
\text{left most point} (h   -a  , k)
 \\
\text{top most point}( h , k + b)
 \\
\text{bottom most point}(h  , k -b )

\end{array}
$$
