In the pervious [[Section 3.3  Circles]] we look at graph and circle since circle are a special cases of ellipses we've already got most of the tools under our belt . All we really need to do to get us started is the standard form of ellipse and info about how to interpret it 

here is the standard form of ellipse 
$$
\frac{(x -  h)^2}{a^2} + \frac{(y  - k)^2} { b^2 }   = 1 
$$
