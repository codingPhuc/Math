# #Definition  
rational  expression , is a  fraction which have the numerator and the  denominator  as a polynomial  here are some basic example : 
$\frac{6}{x-1}$
$\frac{z^2  -1}{z^2 +5}$ 
$\frac{z^2  -1}{1}$ 
the last equation seem to be strange, but the important thing to note is that a polynomials expression can be  thought of as a rational expressions if we need to   
## exception  

when dealing with rational expression  we will always assume that  the denominator $\neq$ 0  

### property of negative fractions
the following are all equivalent  
$$-\frac{a}{b}=\frac{-a}{b^{\bullet}}=\frac{a}{-b}$$
the following are all equivalent , the negative notation on x cannot be factor out of the numerator due to it only being attach to x . In order to  move the negative notation  we much time the numerator by x then shift the negative notation   
$$\frac{-x+3}{x+1}=\frac{-(x-3)}{x+1}=-\frac{x-3}{x+1}$$
## #simplified Rational Expression 

A Rational Expression has been reduce to it lowest terms if all common [[Factor]]s from the numerator and the denominator have been canceled 


## common denominator 
In order for a subtraction  and addition for rational expression  to take place , there much be a common denominator. 

$$\frac{a}{c}+\frac{b}{c}=\frac{a+b}{c} \; \frac{a}{c}-\frac{b}{c}=\frac{a-b}{c}$$

The most suitable choice for a common denominator is the least common  denominator 
example : 
$$\frac{5}{6}-\frac{3}{4}=\frac{5\left(2\right)}{6\left(2\right)}-\frac{3\left(3\right)}{4\left(3\right)}=\frac{10}{12}-\frac{9}{12}=\frac{10-9}{12}=\frac{1}{12}$$
- here we will multiply the left factorial  2 and the right by 3 creating  a common denominator of  12 
finding the least common denominator in a rational expression you need to follow these step 
example : 
$$\frac{4}{6x^2}-\frac{1}{3x^5}+\frac{5}{2x^3}$$
1. reduce the all the  denominator to it factors  
	- $$\frac{4}{3.2x^2}-\frac{1}{3x^5}+\frac{5}{2x^3}$$
2. write down  all the factor that appear at least one , do not write down the  power of a factors 
	- the unique factors that appear is  3,2,x 
3. now for every  coefficient write down it largest power in this cases the coefficient of x have the largest power of 5 
4. the product of all the factors in the previous step is the lcd which is $6x^5$
#  practice exercise
$$
\frac{x^2 - 2x - 8}{x^2 - 9x +20} =  \frac{(x-4)(x+2)}{(x-4)(x-5)}   =\frac{x+2}{x-5}  
$$

[[Factoring  Polynomials#Difference of Squares]]
$$
\frac{x^2  - 25}{(5x-x^2)} =  \frac{(x - 5)(x+5)}{-x(x-5)} =  \frac{x+5}{-x}
$$

[[Factoring  Polynomials#Perfect Square Trinomial (Sum Form)]]
$$
\frac{x^7   + 2x^6  + x^5}{x^3 (x+1)}  = \frac{x^5(x^2+2x + 1)}{x^3(x+1)^8} = \frac{x^5.(x+1)^2}{x^3(x+1)^8} = \frac{x^2}{(x+1)^6}
$$
