# #definition   
In this  point of the chapter we focus on solving  equation  , but now  it time to  solve inequation   .  In your math  career  you must know what   $a<b$  mean that a is less than  b   . On the other hand  ,   $a\geq b$  mean  that  a is  greater or equal to  b     , similarly for  $a \leq b$   and $a>b$ 

Remember to  correctly  interpret equal and inequal   when using the  $\leq$ $\ge$  . The case     $4 \leq  4$  is  just  as must inequal  as     $-6 \leq  4$ 
and the case      $4 <  4$    is not a true  inequal  since  4 is equal  to 4  and  not strictly  less than  4  

Additionally  we will be  seeing double inequal   soo  try to  look  out for  that  

$$-9 <  5  \leq  6$$ since  5  is less than  6  and   larger  than  -9  . We concluded that this cases  is a true double inequal .  In  the other hand  
$$
10 <  5  \leq  20 
$$
this is a  not true  inequal   ,   5 may  be less than  20   but is larger  than  10 . The first inequal  in the equation is  false  while the second is true  ,but just like the  or operation  one   not true inequal  will result  in a double  not  true  inequal

The next topic will be   **interval  notation**  .  Interval  notation   is very  nice shorthand for inequation that will be  used extensively  in the  next few section

Remember that  `[ ] `  mean that  we include the end point while   `( )`  that we do not include the  end point . for the first four inequality graph is  nothing  more  then a graph  with  a number line on it  . For the  final  four  inequality ,  the
