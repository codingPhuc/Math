# #definition   
In this  point of the chapter we focus on solving  equation  , but now  it time to  solve inequation   .  In your math  career  you must know what   $a<b$  mean that a is less than  b   . On the other hand  ,   $a\geq b$  mean  that  a is  greater or equal to  b     , similarly for  $a \leq b$   and $a>b$ 

Remember to  correctly  interpret equal and inequal   when using the  $\leq$ $\ge$  . The case     $4 \leq  4$  is  just  as must inequal  as     $-6 \leq  4$ 
and the case      $4 <  4$    is not a true  inequal  since  4 is equal  to 4  and  not strictly  less than  4  

Additionally  we will be  seeing double inequal   soo  try to  look  out for  that  

$$-9 <  5  \leq  6$$ since  5  is less than  6  and   larger  than  -9  . We concluded that this cases  is a true double inequal .  In  the other hand  
$$
10 <  5  \leq  20 
$$
this is a  not true  inequal   ,   5 may  be less than  20   but is larger  than  10 . The first inequal  in the equation is  false  while the second is true  ,but just like the  or operation  one   not true inequal  will result  in a double  not  true  inequal

The next topic will be   **interval  notation**  .  Interval  notation   is very  nice shorthand for inequation that will be  used extensively  in the  next few section

Remember that  `[ ] `  mean that  we include the end point while   `( )`  that we do not include the  end point . for the first four inequality  table interval  notation    is  nothing  more  then a graph  with  a number line on it  . For the  final  four  inequality ,  the  interval  notation  extended to  almost the entire  graph  . Further more ,  infinity does not geta bracket  it only  get  parentheses 
it is now the time to solve linear  inequality .  In order to do that we will need to used fact for  linear equality  ,  noted that the fact are given  for  <  .  We can  , however  write the equivalent amount of  facts for remaining three inequalities
## Properties of Inequalities  

1. **Addition and Subtraction**  
   If \( a < b \), then for any number \( c \):  
   $$
   a + c < b + c
   $$
   $$
   a - c < b - c
   $$
   In other words, adding or subtracting the same number from both sides of an inequality does not change its direction.  

2. **Multiplication and Division by a Positive Number**  
   If \( a < b \) and \( c > 0 \), then:  
   $$
   a \cdot c < b \cdot c
   $$
   $$
   \frac{a}{c} < \frac{b}{c}
   $$
   Multiplying or dividing both sides of an inequality by a **positive** number keeps the inequality direction unchanged.  

3. **Multiplication and Division by a Negative Number**  
   If \( a < b \) and \( c < 0 \), then:  
   $$
   a \cdot c > b \cdot c
   $$
   $$
   \frac{a}{c} > \frac{b}{c}
   $$
   Multiplying or dividing both sides of an inequality by a **negative** number flips the inequality direction.  
the first two  fact are the one we used to  solve a linear equation ,  the third  fact  however is a  new  constant  and need to  be understand clearly  to not make a mistake 

## Solving the following  inequalities  
$$
\begin{array}{l }
−2(m−3)<5(m+1)−12   \\
-2m   +  6   <   5m + 5    - 12   \\
-7 m <  -13   \\
m  >   \frac{13}{7} 
\end{array}

$$


$$
\begin{array}{l }
2(1−x)+5≤3(2x−1)  \\
2  - 2x   +  5   \leq  6x  -  3   \\
-8x    \leq    -  10    \\
x \geq  \frac{10}{8}  
\end{array}

$$
## Solving double inequation  

to solve a double  inequation  we need  x as the middle term  , remember that if  there  are any operation to ensure that  only x  remain  in the middle term we need to do the same operation , on the left and right term 
$$
\begin{array}{l }
−6≤2(x−5)<7  \\
 -6 \leq 2x - 10  < 7    \\
6 \leq 2x   < 17  \\
3 \leq x   < \frac{17}{2 }  
\end{array}

$$

the interval  notation     of x is  $[3,  \frac{17}{2} )$ 




$$
\begin{array}{l }
−3< \frac{3}{2 } (2−x)≤5 \\
-2     <   2-x  \leq   \frac{10}{3} \\
-4  <   -x    \leq  \frac{4}{3}  \\
- \frac{4}{3}  \leq x   < 4 
\end{array}

$$

the interval  notation     of x is  $[- \frac{4}{3} ,  4 )$ 



$$
\begin{array}{l }
−14 <  −7(3x+2) <  1 \\
\frac{1}{-7}    <  3x+2  <   2   \\
\frac{-15}{7}    <  3x  <  0    \\
- \frac{5}{7} < x   <   0   
\end{array}

$$
the interval  notation     of x is  $(- \frac{5}{7} ,     0 )$ 

It  is  important to note that there can be  error  in the comparison operation used for the inequation .  Like for example the first two equation that we solve above   may switch the <  and $\leq$  to  >  or  $\geq$  so you need to be careful when using  flipping direction of an equation 

###     Find  a  and  b  bases  on the  interval   notation  of x 
x have an  interval  notation  like $−1<x<4$
we need to find  or determine    $a<2x+3<b$ 
if we   add the  start point and end  point  of the x interval into  $2x+3$  we will get the interval of  $2x+3$ which is  $(1, 11 )$  
->  so  a  need to have  an interval of  $( - \infty  ,  1 ]$ and  b  need to have  an interval notation of $[ 11  ,  +\infty   ]$

first  we multiply everything by 2    $−2<2x<8$ 
then add  everything by 3
