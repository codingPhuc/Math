# #definition   
In this  point of the chapter we focus on solving  equation  , but now  it time to  solve inequation   .  In your math  career  you must know what   $a<b$  mean that a is less than  b   . On the other hand  ,   $a\geq b$  mean  that  a is  greater or equal to  b     , similarly for  $a \leq b$   and $a>b$ 

Remember to  correctly  interpret equal and inequal   when using the  $\leq$ $\ge$  . The case     $4 \leq  4$  is  just  as must inequal  as     $-6 \leq  4$ 
and the case      $4 <  4$    is not a true  inequal  since  4 is equal  to 4  and  not strictly  less than  4  

Additionally  we will be  seeing double inequation   soo  try to  look  out for  that
