# #definition   
In this  point of the chapter we focus on solving  equation  , but now  it time to  solve inequation   .  In your math  career  you must know what   $a<b$  mean that a is less than  b   . On the other hand  ,   $a\geq b$  mean  that  a is  greater or equal to  b     , similarly for  $a \leq b$   and $a>b$ 

Remember to  correctly  interpret equal and inequal   when using the  $\leq$ $\ge$  . The case     $4 \leq  4$  is  just  as must inequal  as     $-6 \leq  4$ 
and the case      $4 <  4$    is not a true  inequal  since  4 is equal  to 4  and  not strictly  less than  4  

Additionally  we will be  seeing double inequal   soo  try to  look  out for  that  

$$-9 <  5  \leq  6$$ since  5  is less than  6  and   larger  than  -9  . We concluded that this cases  is a true double inequal .  In  the other hand  
$$
10 <  5  \leq  20 
$$
this is a  not true  inequal   ,   5 may  be less than  20   but is larger  than  10 . The first inequal  in the equation is  false  while the second is true  ,but just like the  or operation  one   not true inequal  will result  in a double  not  true  inequal

The next topic will be   **interval  notation**  .  Interval  notation   is very  nice shorthand for inequation that will be  used extensively  in the  next few section

Remember that  `[ ] `  mean that  we include the end point while   `( )`  that we do not include the  end point . for the first four inequality  table interval  notation    is  nothing  more  then a graph  with  a number line on it  . For the  final  four  inequality ,  the  interval  notation  extended to  almost the entire  graph  . Further more ,  infinity does not geta bracket  it only  get  parentheses 
it is now the time to solve linear  inequality .  In order to do that we will need to used fact for  linear equality  ,  noted that the fact are given  for  <  .  We can  , however  write the equivalent amount of  facts for remaining three inequalities
## Properties of Inequalities  

1. **Addition and Subtraction**  
   If \( a < b \), then for any number \( c \):  
   $$
   a + c < b + c
   $$
   $$
   a - c < b - c
   $$
   In other words, adding or subtracting the same number from both sides of an inequality does not change its direction.  

2. **Multiplication and Division by a Positive Number**  
   If \( a < b \) and \( c > 0 \), then:  
   $$
   a \cdot c < b \cdot c
   $$
   $$
   \frac{a}{c} < \frac{b}{c}
   $$
   Multiplying or dividing both sides of an inequality by a **positive** number keeps the inequality direction unchanged.  

3. **Multiplication and Division by a Negative Number**  
   If \( a < b \) and \( c < 0 \), then:  
   $$
   a \cdot c > b \cdot c
   $$
   $$
   \frac{a}{c} > \frac{b}{c}
   $$
   Multiplying or dividing both sides of an inequality by a **negative** number flips the inequality direction.  
the first two  fact are the one we used to  solve a linear equation ,  the third  fact  however is a  new  constant  and need to  be understand clearly  to not make a mistake 

## Solving the following  inequalities  
$$
\begin{array}{l }
−2(m−3)<5(m+1)−12   \\
-2m   +  6   <   5m + 5    - 12   \\
-7 m <  -13   \\
m  >   \frac{13}{7} 
\end{array}

$$


$$
\begin{array}{l }
2(1−x)+5≤3(2x−1)  \\
2  - 2x   +  5    \\
-7 m <  -13   \\
m  >   \frac{13}{7} 
\end{array}

$$
