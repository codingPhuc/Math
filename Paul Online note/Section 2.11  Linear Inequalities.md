# #definition   
In this  point of the chapter we focus on solving  equation  , but now  it time to  solve inequation   .  In your math  career  you must know what   $a<b$  mean that a is less than  b   . On the other hand  ,   $a\geq b$  mean  that  a is  greater or equal to  b     , similarly for  $a \leq b$   and $a>b$
