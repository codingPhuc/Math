We've been talking about  zeroes of polynomial and why we need them for a couple of section now . We haven't , however , really talk about them for polynomial greater than 2 
. In Addition  in this section we will give a process that will find all rational (_i.e._ integer or fractional) zeroes of a polynomial  . we will be able to used a process for finding zeroes of a polynomial provided that all but  at most two of the zero are not polynomial . If more than two of the process are not rational then this process will not find all of the zero
