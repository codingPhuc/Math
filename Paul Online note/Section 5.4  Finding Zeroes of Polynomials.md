We've been talking about  zeroes of polynomial and why we need them for a couple of section now . We haven't , however , really talk about them for polynomial greater than 2 
. In Addition  in this section we will give a process that will find all rational (_i.e._ integer or fractional) zeroes of a polynomial  . We will providing a process that work if the number of rational zeros solutions >=2, if the number of rational zeros solution < 2  this process will not work 


## Rational Root Theorem 
if the rational number $x=\frac{b}{c}$ is a zero of the $n^{th}$ degree polynomial   
$$
 P (x  )  = sx^n + \dots + t 
$$
where all coefficients are integer then b will be a factor of t and c will be a factor of s 
Note that the  zero must be reduce to the lowest term in order for this to work 

verify that the root of the following polynomial satisfy the  rational root theorem : 
$$
P (x )  = 12 x^3 -  41x^2 - 38 x  + 40  = (x  - 4) (3x - 2) (4x + 5 )
$$

$$
\begin{array}{l}
x = \frac{2}{ 3}   \\
x  = -\frac{5}{4}  \\

\end{array}
$$
