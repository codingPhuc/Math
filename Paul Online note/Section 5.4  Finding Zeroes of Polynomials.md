We've been talking about  zeroes of polynomial and why we need them for a couple of section now . We haven't , however , really talk about them for polynomial greater than 2 
. In Addition  in this section we will give a process that will find all rational (_i.e._ integer or fractional) zeroes of a polynomial  . We will providing a process that work if the number of rational zeros solutions >=2, if the number of rational zeros solution < 2  this process will not work 


## Rational Root Theorem 
if the rational number $x=\frac{b}{c}$ is a zero of the $n^{th}$ degree polynomial   
$$
 P (x  )  = sx^n + \dots + t 
$$
where all coefficients are integer then b will be a factor of t and c will be a factor of s 
Note that the  zero must be reduce to the lowest term in order for this to work 

verify that the root of the following polynomial satisfy the  rational root theorem : 
$$
P (x )  = 12 x^3 -  41x^2 - 38 x  + 40  = (x  - 4) (3x - 2) (4x + 5 )
$$

$$
\begin{array}{l}
x = \frac{2}{ 3}   \\
x  = -\frac{5}{4}  \\  \\
x = \frac{4}{1}
\end{array}
$$
we then check if the zeros solution denominator will be a factor of s and the numerator will be a factor of t 
$t =  40=2\cdot 2\cdot 2\cdot 5$ 
$s = 12=3\cdot 4$
$s = 12=-3\cdot-4$
since the numerator and denominator of the two solution are factor of t and s we concluded that the polynomial satisfy the  rational root theorem

This theorem is important because it allow us to find out the number of combination for zeros solution rational number and it let us verify the rational number solution 

$$
\begin{array}{l} \\
P(x) = x^4 -7x^3 + 17x^2 - 17x + 6     \\

\end{array}
