We've been talking about  zeroes of polynomial and why we need them for a couple of section now . We haven't , however , really talk about them for polynomial greater than 2 
. In Addition  in this section we will give a process that will find all rational (_i.e._ integer or fractional) zeroes of a polynomial  . we will be able to used a process for finding zeroes of a polynomial provided that all but  at most two of the zero are not polynomial . If more than two of the process are not rational then this process will not find all of the zero



## Rational Root Theorem 
if the rational number $x=\frac{b}{c}$ is a zero of the $n^{th}$ degree polynomial   
$$
 P (x  )  = sx^n + \dots + t 
$$
where all coefficients are integer then b will be a factor of t and c will be a factor of s 
Note that the  zero must be reduce to the lowest term in order for this to work
