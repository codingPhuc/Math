In this method we are going to get a rough sketch of a general polynomial. The only information that we are going to need a is a complete list of zero 
In this section we either be given a list of zero or they will be easy to find . In the next section we are going to go into method for determining  large portion of the list for most polynomial . We are graphing first instead of finding all the zero , we will do the other part latter on

Do not worry  about these polynomial we are giving these so that we can have the basic idea of the polynomial . 
First notice how all the hole are nice and smooth . There are no hole in the gap not break in the gap it is always nice an smooth 

Secondly  ,the hole  where the gap turn from increasing to decrease and vice versal are called turning point . For a graph with degree n it will have (n-1) turning point 

While this won't help must in graphing  , it will help in detecting error in our graph . For example if we have fourth degree polynomial with 5 turning point we will quickly spot the error 

Next we need to connect the relationship between the x intercept and the zero point of a polynomial . 
$$
P(x)  = 0 
$$
Also recall , that x = r is a zero of the polynomial , $P(x)$ , provided that $P(r) = 0$ . But that also mean that there is a solution x = r  that satisfy $P(x)$



In other word zero  of the polynomial also is the x intercept of the graph . Recall  , that the x intercept will either cross the graph or touch the x-axist without crossing the axis 

Notice as well that the x-intercept can either flatten out as they cross the x-axis or they can go through the x axis at that angle 


#fact 
	if  $x= r$ is a zero of the polynomial  $P(x)$ with a multiplicity of k then 
	1. if k  is an odd number then the x = r will cross the x axis 
	2. if k is and even number then the x =  r will croc
