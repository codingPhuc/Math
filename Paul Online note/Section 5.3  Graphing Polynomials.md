In this method we are going to get a rough sketch of a general polynomial. The only information that we are going to need a is a complete list of zero 
In this section we either be given a list of zero or they will be easy to find . In the next section we are going to go into method for determining  large portion of the list for most polynomial . We are graphing first instead of finding all the zero , we will do the other part latter on

Do not worry  about these polynomial we are giving these so that we can have the basic idea of the polynomial . 
First notice how all the hole are nice and smooth . There are no hole in the gap not break in the gap it is always nice an smooth
