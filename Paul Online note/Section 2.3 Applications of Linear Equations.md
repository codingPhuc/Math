We will now look at the section  word problem of linear algebra .  This is usually the section where student hate the most . 
# #definition  
## Process for words problem 
1.  read the problem 
2. You need to read the problem very carefully as many time as  it take . You  only done with this if you understood what the problem is asking you to do . This include identifying all the given solution and identifying  what the problem is asking you to do  
3. Represent one of the unknow quantity with a variable and try too relate other unknown quantities  ( if there are of course) to this variable 
4. If applicable sketch  a figure illustrating the problem . this may seem silly step , but it can be helpful with the next step 
5. Form an equation that will relate known quantities with unknown quantities . To do this make use of known formulas and often the figure used in the previous step can be use for this 
6. Solve the equation  in the pervious step  and write down the answer to all the question . It is importance to answer all the question you were asked Often you will be asked for serval quantities in the answer and the equation will only give  one of them  
7. Check your answer ,  this can be archive by  plugging in the answer into the equation  , but also use you intuition to make sense of it . Mistake can often be identify by the answer not making sense 



Example 1Â In a certain Algebra class there is a total of 350 possible points. These points come from 5 homework sets that are worth 10 points each and 3 hour exams that are worth 100 points each. A student has received homework scores of 4, 8, 7, 7, and 9 and the first two exam scores are 78 and 83. Assuming that grades are assigned according to the standard scale and there are no weights assigned to any of the grades is it possible for the student to receive an A in the class and if so what is the minimum score on the third exam that will give an A? What about a B? 

350 possible points.
- 5 homework sets 
	- 10 points each 
- 3 hour exams
	- 100 points each 
A student 
- homework  scores of 4, 8, 7, 7, and 9 
- first two exam  score are  78 and  83 
- 329 is the minimum score to get an A  

$$
4 +  8 +  7 +  7 +  9 + 78 + 83  + x =  329 
$$
