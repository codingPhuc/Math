We will now look at the section  word problem of linear algebra .  This is usually the section where student hate the most . 
# #definition  
## Process for words problem 
1.  read the problem 
2. You need to read the problem very carefully as many time as  it take . You  only done with this if you understood what the problem is asking you to do . This include identifying all the given solution and identifying  what the problem is asking you to do  
3. Represent one of the unknow quantity with a variable and try too relate other unknown quantities  ( if there are of course) to this variable 
4. If applicable sketch  a figure illustrating the problem . this may seem silly step , but it can be helpful with the next step 
5. Form an equation that will relate known quantities with unknown quantities . To do this make use of known formulas and often the figure used in the previous step can be use for this 
6. Solve the equation  in the pervious step  and write down the answer to all the question . It is importance to answer all the question you were asked Often you will be asked for serval quantities in the answer and the equation will only give  one of them  
7. Check your answer ,  this can be archive by  plugging in the answer into the equation  , but also use you intuition to make sense of it . Mistake can often be identify by the answer not making sense 


 1. read the problems 
Example 1 In a certain Algebra class there is a total of 350 possible points. These points come from 5 homework sets that are worth 10 points each and 3 hour exams that are worth 100 points each. A student has received homework scores of 4, 8, 7, 7, and 9 and the first two exam scores are 78 and 83. Assuming that grades are assigned according to the standard scale and there are no weights assigned to any of the grades is it possible for the student to receive an A in the class and if so what is the minimum score on the third exam that will give an A? What about a B? 

2. read the problems carefully to create a bullet list 
350 possible points.
- 5 homework sets 
	- 10 points each 
- 3 hour exams
	- 100 points each 
A student 
- homework  scores of 4, 8, 7, 7, and 9 
- first two exam  score are  78 and  83 
- 329 is the minimum score to get an A  
3 represent one of the unknown quantity with a variable and try to relate other unknown qualities 
okey let start by defining   p the minimum score require  on the third exam 
4 if applicable sketch a figure illustrating a problem 
Now  , lets recall how grade are set  . Since there are no  weight   or anything  on the grades  , the grades will be set first on the following percentage  
5 form a equation that will relate  known quantities with unknown quantities .  
$$
 \frac{actual \; point}{ total \; possible \; point }   = grade \;  percentage 

$$
if the grade percentage is 90 or higher the student will get A . Likewise , if the grade percentage is between  0.8 and 0.9 the student will get a B 

we know that the total point is  350  and the student have the total point of  
$$
4+8+7+7+9+78+83+p=196+p
$$
The smallest possible percentage of A is  0.9 and if  p  is the minimum require score for an A  we will get the following  equation 
$$
\frac{196+  p}{ 350} = 0.9

$$
this is the liner equation that we will need to solve for p  
$$
196+p=0.9(350)=315⇒p=315−196=119 
$$
So the minimum require score is 119  . This is a problem  since the exam is worth only 100 points .  In others words , the student will not get a A in algebra class  . Then how about a B 

6 solve the equation in the pervious step  and write down your answer to the equation 

$$
\frac{196+  p}{ 350} = 0.8  
$$
7 check your answer by plugging in the answer into the equation 
$$
196+p=0.8(350)=280⇒p=280−196=84
$$
So , it is possible for the student  to get a B  in the class . All the student need to do is get  at least 84  on the third exam

We want to build a set of shelves. The width of the set of shelves needs to be 4 times the height of the set of shelves and the set of shelves must have three shelves in it. If there are 72 feet of wood to use to build the set of shelves what should the dimensions of the set of shelves be?

build a set of shelves 
- width 
	- 4 times the height 
- height 
- length  
	-  three shelves in it 
- 72 feet of wood use to build the set of shelves 
what is the wood need to build the shelves

we will define the heigh , width and length as  the variables h , w and l , respectively  
l = 3.x  
w =  
h =

A calculator has been marked up 15% and is being sold for $78.50. How much did the store pay the manufacturer of the calculator?
2 read the problem to create a bullet  list 
calculator  
- manufacturer price 
	-  marked  up 15%
How much did the store pay the manufacturer  of the calculator  ?  

3 represent one of the unknown quantity with a variable and try to relate other unknown qualities 
we will define the  manufacturer  price as variable x   . 




5 Form an equation that will relate known quantities with unknown quantities . To do this make use of known formulas   
we know that  the price have been mark up by 15% causing the price being sold  for $78.50 .  Therefore, the manufacture price , plus 15%  of that price , equal to the selling  price creating this formula 


$$
\begin{array}{l}
x  +  (x \cdot 15\% )  =78.50    \\
\frac{23}{20}x   =  78.50  \\
x = 68.26 
\end{array}

A shirt is on sale for $15.00 and has been marked down 35%. How much was the shirt being sold for before the sale?
2 read the problem to create a bullet  list 
original price of the shirt  
- on sale for $15.00 
- marked down 35% 
how much is the original price 
3 represent one of the unknown quantity with a variable and try to relate other unknown qualities  
we will define the original price as  p  
5 Form an equation that will relate known quantities with unknown quantities . To do this make use of known formulas   
we know that that the original price have been marked down 35%  . Therefore , the original  price  , subtract by 35% or the discounted price , equal to the selling price creating this formula 
$$
\begin{array}{l}
x  -  (x \cdot 35\% )  =15    \\
0.65 x     =  15  \\
x = 27.07
