We will now look at the section  word problem of linear algebra .  This is usually the section where student hate the most . 
# #definition  
## Process for words problem 
1.  read the problem 
2. You need to read the problem very carefully as many time as  it take . You  only done with this if you understood what the problem is asking you to do . This include identifying all the given solution and identifying  what the problem is asking you to do  
3. Represent one of the unknow quantity with a variable and try too relate other unknown quantities  ( if there are of course) to this variable 
4. If applicable sketch  a figure illustrating the problem . this may seem silly step , but it can be helpful with the next step 
5. Form an equation that will relate known quantities with unknown quantities . To do this make use of known formulas and often the figure used in the previous step can be use for this 
6. Solve the equation  in the pervious step  and write down the answer to all the question . It is importance to answer all the question you were asked Often you will be asked for serval quantities in the answer and the equation will only give  one of them  
7. Check your answer ,  this can be archive by  plugging in the answer into the equation  , but also use you intuition to make sense of it . Mistake can often be identify by the answer not making sense 


 1. read the problems 
Example 1 In a certain Algebra class there is a total of 350 possible points. These points come from 5 homework sets that are worth 10 points each and 3 hour exams that are worth 100 points each. A student has received homework scores of 4, 8, 7, 7, and 9 and the first two exam scores are 78 and 83. Assuming that grades are assigned according to the standard scale and there are no weights assigned to any of the grades is it possible for the student to receive an A in the class and if so what is the minimum score on the third exam that will give an A? What about a B? 

2. read the problems carefully to create a bullet list 
350 possible points.
- 5 homework sets 
	- 10 points each 
- 3 hour exams
	- 100 points each 
A student 
- homework  scores of 4, 8, 7, 7, and 9 
- first two exam  score are  78 and  83 
- 329 is the minimum score to get an A  
3 represent one of the unknown quantity with a variable and try to relate other unknown qualities 
okey let start by defining   p the minimum score require  on the third exam 
4 if applicable sketch a figure illustrating a problem 
Now  , lets recall how grade are set  . Since there are no  weight   or anything  on the grades  , the grades will be set first on the following percentage  
5 form a equation that will relate  known quantities with unknown quantities .  
$$
 \frac{actual \; point}{ total \; possible \; point }   = grade \;  percentage 

$$
if the grade percentage is 90 or higher the student will get A . Likewise , if the grade percentage is between  0.8 and 0.9 the student will get a B 

we know that the total point is  350  and the student have the total point of  
$$
4+8+7+7+9+78+83+p=196+p
$$
The smallest possible percentage of A is  0.9 and if  p  is the minimum require score for an A  we will get the following  equation 
$$
\frac{196+  p}{ 350} = 0.9

$$
this is the liner equation that we will need to solve for p  
$$
196+p=0.9(350)=315⇒p=315−196=119 
$$
So the minimum require score is 119  . This is a problem  since the exam is worth only 100 points .  In others words , the student will not get a A in algebra class  . Then how about a B 

6 solve the equation in the pervious step  and write down your answer to the equation 

$$
\frac{196+  p}{ 350} = 0.8  
$$
7 check your answer by plugging in the answer into the equation 
$$
196+p=0.8(350)=280⇒p=280−196=84
$$
So , it is possible for the student  to get a B  in the class . All the student need to do is get  at least 84  on the third exam

2 read the problem to create a bullet  list 
calculator  
- manufacturer price 
	-  marked  up 15%
How much did the store pay the manufacturer  of the calculator  ?  

3 represent one of the unknown quantity with a variable and try to relate other unknown qualities 
we will define the  manufacturer  price as variable x   . 




5 Form an equation that will relate known quantities with unknown quantities . To do this make use of known formulas   
we know that  the price have been mark up by 15% causing the price being sold  for $78.50 .  Therefore, the manufacture price , plus 15%  of that price , equal to the selling  price creating this formula 


$$
\begin{array}{l}
x  +  (x \cdot 15\% )  =78.50    \\
\frac{23}{20}x   =  78.50  \\
x = 68.26 
\end{array}

- marked down 35% 
how much is the original price 
3 represent one of the unknown quantity with a variable and try to relate other unknown qualities  
we will define the original price as  p  
5 Form an equation that will relate known quantities with unknown quantities . To do this make use of known formulas   
we know that that the original price have been marked down 35%  . Therefore , the original  price  , subtract by 35% or the discounted price , equal to the selling price creating this formula 
$$
\begin{array}{l}
x  -  (x \cdot 35\% )  =15    \\
0.65 x     =  15  \\
x = 27.07

Two cars are 500 miles apart and moving directly towards each other. One car is moving at a speed of 100 mph and the other is moving at 70 mph. Assuming that the cars start moving at the same time how long does it take for the two cars to meet?  

2 read the problem carefully to create a bullet list 
two  car 
- 500 miles apart 
- moving toward each other
	- first car 
		- 100mph 
	- second car 
		- 70 mph 

3 represent one of the unknown quantity with a variable and try to relate other unknown qualities 
we will define  the variable t as the time for the two car to meet 

5 Form an equation that will relate known quantities with unknown quantities . To do this make use of known formulas    
We know that both car travel  at the same time to meet each other , which help us identify that the distance that each car travel will be different bases on the rate of each car . Therefore , the  rate of the first car multiply by t plus the rate of the second car multiply by t will equal to the total distance of 500 
$$
\begin{array} {l}
100 \cdot t   +  70 \cdot t  = 500     \\
t  = 2.94 \; hour 
\end{array} 



$$
so it will take them approximately  2.94 before meeting

- 500 miles apart 
- moving toward each other
	- first car 
		-  start 1 hour latter 
		- 100mph 
	- second car

3 represent one of the unknown  quantity with a  variable and  try to relate other unknown qualities we will define the variable t as the time for the two car to meet 


5 Form an equation that will relate known quantities with unknown quantities . To do this make use of known formulas  

We know that the fastest car travel later than the slowest car  by 1 hour    , which help us identify that the distance that each car travel will be different bases on the rate of each car and the fastest car will be late by one hour . Therefore , the rate of the first car will be multiply with t minus  1 plus rate of the second car multiply by t will equal to the total distance of 500  
$$
\begin{array} {l}
100 \cdot (t   - 1 )    +  70 \cdot t  = 500     \\
100t - 100  + 70t  = 500 \; hour   \\
100t - 100  + 70t  = 3.52  \; hour 
\end{array} 


$$
in this cases the car will travel for  3.53 hours  before  meeting while  the faster car will travel for 2.53

Two boats start out 100 miles apart and start moving to the right at the same time. The boat on the left is moving at twice the speed as the boat on the right. Five hours after starting the boat on the left catches up with the boat on the right. How fast was each boat moving? 
2 read the problem create bullet point 
Two boats start out 100 miles 
- boat on the left   twice speed  on the right  
- boat on the right
- Five hours after starting the boat on the left catches up with the boat on the right 

We know that the boat on the left is moving twice as fast as the boat on the right and both boat are 100 miles  apart at the start , after five hours the boat on the left move  faster than the boat on the right. Therefore  , the rate of the right boat multiply by time that reach the second  plus the distance between the boat at the start  , equal to  the rate multiply of the boat on the right multiply by 2 and 5  


$$
\begin{array}{l}
r2\cdot5  + 100  =  2\cdot5\cdot  r2  \\
5\cdot r2   =  100 \\
r2  =  20 \; mph  \\
r1  = 40 \; mph 
\end{array}
 
$$

so the boat on the right travel at  20 mph  and r1 travel at 40 mph

two envelope stuffing machines  
- Machine A can stuff a batch of envelopes in   
- Machine B can stuff a batch of envelopes in 3 hours 
- How long would it take the two machines working together to stuff a batch of envelopes? 


|             | total  hours | how much per hours |

| Total hours | x            | 1/x                |

$$

\begin{array}{l}
\frac{1}{5}   +  \frac{1}{3}  = \frac{1}{x}  \\
3x     +  5x =  15 \\
x = \frac{15}{8}    \\

$$

So, it looks like it will take  the John   11.7  hours to clean the complex by himself 


How much of a 50% alcohol solution should we mix with 10 gallons of a 35% solution to get a 40% solution?  
40% solution?  
- 50% alcohol solution  how much ? 
-  10 gallons of a  35% solution  

define x is the amount need to be mix to create  a 40% solution 
$$ 
\begin{array}{l}
x\cdot50\%  +  10\cdot35\%  =(10+ x)40\%  \\
x\cdot50\% + 10\cdot35\%  = 4  +  40\%x   \\
0.1x =0.5
x = 5 \end{array}


$$ 

so we need to mix  5 gallons of 35% solution to get 40% solution
