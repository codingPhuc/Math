We will now look at the section  word problem of linear algebra .  This is usually the section where student hate the most .

## Process for words problem 
1.  read the problem 
2. You need to read the problem very carefully as many time as  it take . You  only done with this if you understood what the problem is asking you to do . This include identifying all the given solution and identifying  what the problem is asking you to do  
3. Represent one of the unknow quantity with a variable and try too relate other unknown quantities  ( if there are of course) to this variable 
4. If applicable sketch  a figure illustrating the problem . this may seem silly step , but it can be helpful with the next step 
5. Form an equation that will relate known quantities with unknown quantities . To do this make use of known formulas and often the figure used in the previous step can be use for this
