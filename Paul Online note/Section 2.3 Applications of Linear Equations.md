We will now look at the section  word problem of linear algebra .  This is usually the section where student hate the most . 
# #definition  
## Process for words problem 
1.  read the problem 
2. You need to read the problem very carefully as many time as  it take . You  only done with this if you understood what the problem is asking you to do . This include identifying all the given solution and identifying  what the problem is asking you to do  
3. Represent one of the unknow quantity with a variable and try too relate other unknown quantities  ( if there are of course) to this variable 
4. If applicable sketch  a figure illustrating the problem . this may seem silly step , but it can be helpful with the next step 
5. Form an equation that will relate known quantities with unknown quantities . To do this make use of known formulas and often the figure used in the previous step can be use for this 
6. Solve the equation  in the pervious step  and write down the answer to all the question . It is importance to answer all the question you were asked Often you will be asked for serval quantities in the answer and the equation will only give  one of them  
7. Check your answer ,  this can be archive by  plugging in the answer into the equation  , but also use you intuition to make sense of it . Mistake can often be identify by the answer not making sense

### Practice Examples

#### Example 1: Algebra Class Grades

- **Total possible points:** 350
    - **Homework:** 5 sets, 10 points each
    - **Exams:** 3 hour exams, 100 points each
- **Student scores:**
    - Homework: 4, 8, 7, 7, 9
    - Exams: 78, 83
- **Minimum points required:**
    - **For an A:** 329 points
    - **For a B:** Calculated below

**Step 1: Define variable** Let pp be the minimum required score on the third exam.

**Step 2: Calculate total current points**

4+8+7+7+9+78+83+p=196+p4+8+7+7+9+78+83+p=196+p

**Step 3: Solve for pp** For an A (90% or higher):

196+p350=0.9\frac{196+ p}{350} = 0.9 196+p=0.9(350)=315⇒p=315−196=119196+p=0.9(350)=315\Rightarrow p=315-196=119

Since 119 is greater than 100, it is impossible to achieve an A.

For a B (80-89%):

196+p350=0.8\frac{196+ p}{350} = 0.8 196+p=0.8(350)=280⇒p=280−196=84196+p=0.8(350)=280\Rightarrow p=280-196=84

Thus, the student needs at least 84 on the third exam to get a B.

#### Example 2: Building Shelves

- **Shelves specifications:**
    - Width = 4 × Height
    - Height = hh
    - Length = Three shelves
    - Total wood available: 72 feet

Using perimeter equations, solve for dimensions.

---

#### Example 3: Calculator Price Markup

- **Selling price:** $78.50
- **Markup:** 15%
- **Find:** Manufacturer price xx

Equation:

x+(x⋅15%)=78.50 x + (x \cdot 15\%) =78.50 2320x=78.50⇒x=68.26\frac{23}{20}x = 78.50 \Rightarrow x = 68.26

Thus, the manufacturer price is **$68.26**.

---

#### Example 4: Shirt Discount

- **Sale price:** $15.00
- **Discount:** 35%
- **Find:** Original price xx

Equation:

x−(x⋅35%)=15 x - (x \cdot 35\%) =15 0.65x=15⇒x=27.070.65 x = 15 \Rightarrow x = 27.07

Thus, the original price was **$27.07**.

---

#### Example 5: Cars Moving Toward Each Other

- **Initial distance:** 500 miles
- **Speeds:**
    - Car 1: 100 mph
    - Car 2: 70 mph
- **Find:** Time tt to meet

Equation:

100t+70t=500100t + 70t = 500 t=2.94 hourst = 2.94 \text{ hours}

Thus, they will meet in approximately **2.94 hours**.

---

#### Example 6: Delayed Start for Faster Car

- **Same as previous example, but Car 1 starts 1 hour later**

Equation:

100(t−1)+70t=500100(t - 1) + 70t = 500 170t−100=500170t - 100 = 500 t=3.52 hours(fastercar:2.52hours)t = 3.52 \, \text{hours} (faster car: 2.52 hours)

Thus, the total time before meeting is **3.52 hours**.

---

#### Example 7: Boat Speeds

- **Initial distance:** 100 miles
- **Boat 1 speed:** Twice Boat 2
- **Time:** 5 hours

Equation:

5r2+100=10r25r_2 + 100 = 10r_2 5r2=100⇒r2=20,r1=405r_2 = 100 \Rightarrow r_2 = 20, r_1 = 40

Thus, **Boat 2 = 20 mph, Boat 1 = 40 mph**.

---

#### Example 8: Envelope Stuffing Machines

- **Machine A:** 5 hours
- **Machine B:** 3 hours
- **Find:** Time xx working together

Equation:

15+13=1x\frac{1}{5} + \frac{1}{3} = \frac{1}{x} 3x+5x=15⇒x=158=1.875 hours3x + 5x = 15 \Rightarrow x = \frac{15}{8} = 1.875 \, \text{hours}

Thus, working together they take **1.875 hours**.

---

#### Example 9: Cleaning an Office

- **Mary:** 5 hours
- **Together:** 3.5 hours
- **Find:** John's time xx

Equation:

15+1x=27\frac{1}{5} + \frac{1}{x} = \frac{2}{7} 7x+35=10x⇒x=11.7 hours7x + 35 = 10x \Rightarrow x = 11.7 \, \text{hours}

Thus, John takes **11.7 hours** alone.

---

#### Example 10: Mixing Alcohol Solutions

- **Mix:** 50% alcohol with 10 gallons of 35%
- **Result:** 40% solution
- **Find:** Amount xx to mix

Equation:

x(0.5)+10(0.35)=(10+x)0.4 x(0.5) + 10(0.35) = (10 + x)0.4 0.1x=0.5⇒x=50.1x = 0.5 \Rightarrow x = 5

Thus, mix **5 gallons** of 50% solution.

---

#### Example 11: Diluting Acid Solution

- **Goal:** 75 liters of 15% acid solution
- **Start with:** 40% solution
- **Find:** Water to add xx

Equation:

x(0)+(75−x)(0.4)=0.15(75) x(0) + (75 - x)(0.4) = 0.15(75) 30−0.4x=11.25⇒x=46.87530 - 0.4x = 11.25 \Rightarrow x = 46.875

Thus, add **46.875 liters** of water.
