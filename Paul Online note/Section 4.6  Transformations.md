In this section we are going to go though simple graph that are going to help us solve simple problem . This section is called **transformations** 

## vertical Shifts 
The first transformation that we will be looking at is a vertical shift 
Given the graphs of $f(x)$ the graph of $g(x)=f(x) + c$ will be the graph of $f(x)$ shifted up by $c$ units if c is positive and or down by c units if c is negative
