# #definition  
We' ll start off the solving portion of the chapter by   solving a linear equation ,  a linear equation is any equation that is written  in the form  : 
$$ax +  b  =  0$$ where a and b  is a real number and x  is a variable  . This is the standard form of a linear equation  . Note that most linear equation do not start of with form   .Also  , the variable are not always x so do not assume x for every linear equation 

$a=b$ then $a+ c   =  b + c$ this is all  to say that we can add c to each side of the equation 
$a=b$ then $a- c   =  b + c$ this is all  to say that we can subject  c to each side of the equation 
$a=b$ then $a\cdot c  =  b\cdot c$ this is all  to say that we can multiply c to each side of the equation 
a = b then $\frac{a}{c}  =\frac{b}{c}$ for nay non-zero c . We can divided  both side  of an equation  by a non-zero number . c without changing the equation 
One way to thing of these rule is that . What we do to one side  of the equation we will do to the other side of the equation
