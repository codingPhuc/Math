We' ll start off the solving portion of the chapter by   solving a linear equation ,  a linear equation is any equation that is written  in the form  : 
$$ax +  b  =  0$$ where a and b  is a real number and x  is a variable  . This is the standard form of a linear equation  . Note that most linear equation do not start of with form   .Also  , the variable are not always x so do not assume x for every linear equation
