in this chapter we will be solving  rational  inequation  .   It is the same process as solving  [[Section 2.12  Polynomial Inequalities]] 
$$
\frac{x + 1}{ x - 5} \leq    0  

$$
We do  not  solve it the same way we solve rational  expression  . With equation the first thing  we did  was  clear out the denominator by  multiplying it  with the less  common denominator  .   However    , that solution will not work  this  time  
Since we do not  know  if the denominator will be a positive or negative value   ,  because  if we were to  multiply  the   sign of the comparator will switch  side  leading  to  un predictable out  come  for  our equation  . To make thing  worse , recall that the solution of x  for the equation can be  both  positive and negative 
1. the first step  is to  get zero  on  one side 
2. the second step is to factor   the  numer
