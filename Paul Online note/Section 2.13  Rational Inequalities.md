in this chapter we will be solving  rational  inequation  .   It is the same process as solving  [[Section 2.12  Polynomial Inequalities]] 
$$
\frac{x + 1}{ x - 5} \leq    0  

$$
We do  not  solve it the same way we solve rational  expression  . With equation the first thing  we did  was  clear out the denominator by  multiplying it  with the less  common denominator  .
