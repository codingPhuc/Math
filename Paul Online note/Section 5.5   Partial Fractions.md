This section doesn't really have to  do with the rest of this chapter , but since it need to be cover in such a short chapter it will be a good way to cover it  


Let's suppose we add the two rational expression 


$$
 \begin{array}{l}
\begin{gathered}\frac{8}{x+1}-\frac{5}{x-4}=\frac{8\left(x-4\right)}{\left(x+1\right)\left(x-4\right)}-\frac{5\left(x+1\right)}{\left(x+1\right)\left(x-4\right)}\\=\frac{8x-32-(5x+5)}{\left(x+1\right)\left(x-4\right)}\\=\frac{3x-37}{\left(x+1\right)\left(x-4\right)}\end{gathered}
\end{array}
$$
