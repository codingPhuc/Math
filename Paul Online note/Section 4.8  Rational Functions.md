In this final section we will discuss  graphing  rational function .  It's best to start of with a simple one that we can do without all the knowledge in this work 
Let's sketch the graph of $f(x) =\frac{1}{x}$ . First , since this is a rational function we have too be careful with a division by  0 problem . In this equation we need to avoid $x=0$ since that will give division by zero

Now , let plug in some value of x to see what we see 

| x       | f(x)   |
|---------|--------|
| -4      | -0.25  |
| -2      | -0.5   |
| -1      | -1     |
| -0.1    | -10    |
| -0.01   | -100   |
| 0.01    | 100    |
| 0.1     | 10     |
| 1       | 1      |
| 2       | 0.5    |
| 4       | 0.25   |

So , as x get large (both positive and negative) the function keep the sign of x and gets smaller and smaller . Likewise , as we approach $x=0$ the function again keep the same sign of x but start getting quick large
