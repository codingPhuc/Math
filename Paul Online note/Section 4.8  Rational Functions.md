In this final section we will discuss  graphing  rational function .  It's best to start of with a simple one that we can do without all the knowledge in this work 
Let's sketch the graph of $f(x) =\frac{1}{x}$ . First , since this is a rational function we have too be careful with a division by  0 problem . In this equation we need to avoid $x=0$ since that will give division by zero
