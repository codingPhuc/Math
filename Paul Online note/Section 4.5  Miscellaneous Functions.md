# #definition  
##  Constant Function
this is the easiest  problem we'll  graph though will cause a lot of problem 

$$
f(x)  = c 
$$
where c is some number 
let take a look at  $f(x) =  4$ the biggest problem that student have for these function is that there is no x on the right side to plug into the function . However , this mean that there is no substitution to do . In other word , no matter the value of x we will always get a value of 4 (c in the general cases ) out of the function 

So , every  point has a y coordinate of 4 . This is exactly what is define as the horizontal line . In fact , we can recall that $f(x)$ is nothing more than a fancy way of writing y 

$$
y = 4
$$

this is the equation of the horizontal line
