# #definition 
in this section we will revisit some of the application we saw  in the [[Section 2.3 Applications of Linear Equations]] section and see  some example  that require us to sole  a quadratic equation to get answer 
1.  read the  question  
We are going to fence in a rectangular field and we know that for some reason we want the field to have an enclosed area of 75 ft2. We also know that we want the width of the field to be 3 feet longer than the length of the field. What are the dimensions of the field?
2.  read the question  again to draw a bullet  list 

area  of  75  
- (3  +  l ) = w 
3.  create a  variable representing the  value we need to find   we say  the length and width  of  a rectangle is 
4. create an equation bases on the provided value and  variable  
$$ \begin{array} {l}  
 l  \cdot(3  +  l )     =  75   \\
3l  +  l^2    = 75    \\
l   =   \frac{  -3 \pm \sqrt{ 9 -  4 \cdot -75  }}{2}
\end{array}   $$  will  will have one  negative from $\frac{  -3 - \sqrt{ 9 -  4 \cdot -75  }}{2}$  so we have to eliminate it 



when  we  solve a practical   application  of   quadratic  equation  ,  we should not see any complex  number instead a double  root or two real solution  .  Also ,  as  the pervious example show  ,  we  will need to eliminate one of them  for  physical reason   


Example 2 Two cars start out at the same point. One car starts out driving north at 25 mph. Two hours later the second car starts driving east at 20 mph. How long after the first car starts traveling does it take for the two cars to be 300 miles apart? 

Two cars start out at the same point  
-  One car starts out driving north at 25 mph  
-  Two hours later the second car starts driving  starts driving east at 20 mph   
- How long after the first car starts traveling does it take for the two cars to be 300 miles apart? 
we  say that the time   it took  the car a  and b  to get there is  t

$$
\begin{array}{l}
(20(T-2))^2    +  (25T)^2    =   300^2   \\
400(t -  2)^2  +  625T^2   =  300^2    \\
 400(t^2 -  4t + 4)  +  625T^2   =   300^2     \\
400t^2    -  1600t  +  1600  +   625T^2   = 300^2        \\
1025t^2   -    1600t -88400 =  0   \\
t =  \frac{800 \pm  \sqrt{ 1600^2   -  4 \cdot -88400  \cdot 1025   }  }{2050}  
\\ t=  10.09998   \\
t =  −8.539011

An office has two envelope stuffing machines. Working together they can stuff a batch of envelopes in 2 hours. Working separately, it will take the second machine 1 hour longer than the first machine to stuff a batch of envelopes. How long would it take each machine to stuff a batch of envelopes by themselves?
