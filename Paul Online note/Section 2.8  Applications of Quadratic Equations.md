# #definition 
in this section we will revisit some of the application we saw  in the [[Section 2.3 Applications of Linear Equations]] section and see  some example  that require us to sole  a quadratic equation to get answer 
1.  read the  question  
We are going to fence in a rectangular field and we know that for some reason we want the field to have an enclosed area of 75 ft2. We also know that we want the width of the field to be 3 feet longer than the length of the field. What are the dimensions of the field?
2.  read the question  again to draw a bullet  list 

area  of  75  
- (3  +  l ) = w 
3.  create a  variable representing the  value we need to find   we say  the length and width  of  a rectangle is 
4. create an equation bases on the provided value and  variable  
$$ \begin{array} {l}  
 l  \cdot(3  +  l )     =  75   \\
3l  +  l^2    = 75    \\
l   =   \frac{ }{}
\end{array}   $$  



when  we  solve a practical   application  of   quadratic  equation  ,  we should not see any complex  number instead a double  root or two real solution  .  Also ,  as  the pervious example show  ,  we  will need to eliminate one of them  for  physical reason
