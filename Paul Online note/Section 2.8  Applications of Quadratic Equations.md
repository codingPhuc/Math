# #definition 
in this section we will revisit some of the application we saw  in the [[Section 2.3 Applications of Linear Equations]] section and see  some example  that require us to sole  a quadratic equation to get answer 

We are going to fence in a rectangular field and we know that for some reason we want the field to have an enclosed area of 75 ft2. We also know that we want the width of the field to be 3 feet longer than the length of the field. What are the dimensions of the field?
