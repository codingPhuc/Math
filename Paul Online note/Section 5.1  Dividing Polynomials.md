In this section we need to take a look at dividing polynomials . This is something we will be doing off and on though out the rest of this chapter . 



$$
\frac{5x^3   -  x^2  +    0 x   +  6  }{x  -4}
$$
we need to  write down the term in decreasing order .  Making sure to not make any mistake we add in a missing term  with a zero coefficient  

Now  we need to ask what we need to multiply  by  $x - 4$  to get the first term in the numerator polynomial . In this cases $5x^2$ so multiply $x-4$  by $5x^2$  then subtract it by the
