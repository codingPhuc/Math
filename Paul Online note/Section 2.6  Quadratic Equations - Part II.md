# #definition  
In  section  [[Section 2.5  Quadratic Equations - Part I]]  we look  at solving  Quadratic equation using square root method  and  factoring method . But this have it own  problem  ,  not all equation  can be apply these two method 
In this section  we will look at two method the first is **completing the square**  and the   quadratic  formula  for solving  the equation 

$$ax^2+bx+c=0\; aâ‰ 0$$
## Completing the Square 
The process  call completing the Square  ,  like it suggest need to  completed  the square inorder to solve the equation  .  So  let first  define what completing the square is   
$$x^2  + bx $$
