# #definition  
In  section  [[Section 2.5  Quadratic Equations - Part I]]  we look  at solving  Quadratic equation using square root method  and  factoring method . But this have it own  problem  ,  not all equation  can be apply these two method 
In this section  we will look at two method the first is **completing the square**  and the   quadratic  formula  for solving  the equation 

$$ax^2+bx+c=0\; aâ‰ 0$$
## Completing the Square 
The process  call completing the Square  ,  like it suggest need to  completed  the square inorder to solve the equation  .  So  let first  define what completing the square is   
$$x^2  + bx $$ 
we  notice that the  x^2  have a coefficient  of one .  That is require  in order to do this     .  Now  ,  to this let add $\left( \frac{b}{2} \right)^2$ doing this give the following **factorable**  equation  


$$x^2  + bx  +  \left( \frac{b}{2} \right)^2  =  \left( x + \frac{b}{2} \right)^2 $$ this process  is call  **completing the square** 

$$ x^2 -   16x + 64      =  ( x -   8  )^2    $$ 

$$y^2   +  7y + \frac{49}{4}  = \left( x +  \frac{7}{2} \right)^2$$ 
## example   2 used  completing the square to solve the  following  quadratic  equation 
 

$$ 

\begin{array}  {l} 
x^2  - 6x   + 1   =     0   \\
x^2  - 6x   + 1   + \left( -\frac{6}{2} \right)^2      =  0     \\
(x  - 4)(x  +  3 ) =    0    \\
\left\{
\begin{array}{l}
x  - 4 = 0  \\
y + 3 = 0   \\

\end{array} \\
\implies
\left\{
\begin{array}{l}
y  = 4 \\
y =  - 3  \\

\end{array}
\right.
\right. 

\end{array}
