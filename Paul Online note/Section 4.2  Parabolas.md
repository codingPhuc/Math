In this section we want to look at the graph of a quadratic function . The most general form of the quadratic function is 
$$
f(x)   = ax^2   + bx + c
$$
the graph of the  function are called **parabolas** . here are some example of parabolas

all parabolas are vaguely "U" shaped and they will have a highest and lowest point  called the vertex .  Parabolas may open  up or down and may or may not have a x-intercept but they will almost have a single y-intercept 
parabola that open down will always open down and parabola that open up will always open up . As a result , an parabola does not start opening up if it already start opening down and vice versa 

the dash line in a parabolas is called the axis of symmetry . Every parabolas have a axis of symmetry , additionally as the graph show , the graph
