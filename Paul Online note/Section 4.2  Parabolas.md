# #definition  

In this section we want to look at the graph of a quadratic function . The most general form of the quadratic function is 
$$
f(x)   = ax^2   + bx + c
$$
the graph of the  function are called **parabolas** . here are some example of parabolas 
![[Pasted image 20250403173519.png]]
all parabolas are vaguely "U" shaped and they will have a highest and lowest point  called the vertex .  Parabolas may open  up or down and may or may not have a x-intercept but they will almost have a single y-intercept 
parabola that open down will always open down and parabola that open up will always open up . As a result , an parabola does not start opening up if it already start opening down and vice versa 

the dash line in a parabolas is called the axis of symmetry . Every parabolas have a axis of symmetry , additionally the graph in one side of the axis of symmetry is a mirror to another 

intercepts are the point where the graph will cross the x and y axis . We also saw a graph in [[Section 3.1 Graphing#Determine the x-intercepts and y-intercepts for each of the following equations.]] where a graph touch the intercept but does not cross it
