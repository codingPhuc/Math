Quadratic  Equation   
Standard from of a quadratic equation is 

$$
ax^2   + b x + c =   0  \; a \neq  0  
$$
The only requirement  is that we have  x^2  in the equation  . We guarantee this term  by the requirement  $a\neq0$  . Note  that b and c can be 0  
There are  many way to solve a  quadratic equation . We will be presenting 4  way
