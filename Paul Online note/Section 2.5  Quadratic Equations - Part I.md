Quadratic  Equation   
Standard from of a quadratic equation is 

$$
ax^2   + b x + c =   0  \; a \neq  0  
$$
The only requirement  is that we have  x^2  in the equation  . We guarantee this term  by the requirement  $a\neq0$  . Note  that b and c can be 0  
There are  many way to solve a  quadratic equation . We will be presenting 4  way . For the first two  method it is easy to implement but does not work  for all cases  . On the other  hand,  the last two method  will always work  but require more attention  to  work 


##  solving by factoring  
we are solving the equation first by  factoring them  . we will implement  the following  thing ;  

$$if ;\  ab = 0  \;  then \; either \; a = 0  \; and \; or b  = 0 $$ 

This fact is called the **zero factor property** or **zero factor principle**  .  All the fact  is saying that if the product of the two term is  0  then at least one have to be zero to start with  
Note that this method only work if the product of the terms is zero . To solve a  quadratic equation by  factoring we first must move all the terms over to one side of the equation . Doing it this way serve two purpose   .First is converting  the quadratic into a form that can be factor  .  Secondly  ,  to  have zero  factor there must be  a zero  on one side of the equation . 
Let show  a couple of example  .
