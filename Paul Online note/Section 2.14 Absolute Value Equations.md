we will  look at equation  and   inequation  that  contain absolute value .  We  will  look  at equations  with  absolute  value in them  and  look  at inequation in the next chapter
we need to discuss that the  notation for absolute  value is  p  and $\mid p \mid$ note  that the bar for  absolute value is  not parentheses 

##  Geometric Definition 
In this definition  we are going to thing  of  $asb$
