we will  look at equation  and   inequation  that  contain absolute value .  We  will  look  at equations  with  absolute  value in them  and  look  at inequation in the next chapter
we need to discuss that the  notation for absolute  value is  p  and $\mid p \mid$ note  that the bar for  absolute value is  not parentheses 

##  Geometric Definition 
In this definition  we are going to thing  of  $\mid p \mid$ as  the distance of p from the origin  on the number line   . Also  , we will  always  use a positive value for distance

 from this  we can get the following  absolute value 
 $$
 \mid  2 \mid  = 2     \;  \mid -3 \mid  = 3  \; \mid \frac{9}{2} \mid    =  \frac{9}{2}
 $$
 
## mathematic Definition  
we can  also  give a strict mathematical  formula   for  definition
