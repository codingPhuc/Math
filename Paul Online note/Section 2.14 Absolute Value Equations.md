we will  look at equation  and   inequation  that  contain absolute value .  We  will  look  at equations  with  absolute  value in them  and  look  at inequation in the next chapter
we need to discuss that the  notation for absolute  value is  p  and $\mid p \mid$ note  that the bar for  absolute value is  not parentheses 

##  Geometric Definition 
In this definition  we are going to thing  of  $\mid p \mid$ as  the distance of p from the origin  on the number line   . Also  , we will  always  use a positive value for distance 
 ![[Pasted image 20250320194833.png]] 
 from this  we can get the following  absolute value 
 $$
 \mid  2 \mid  = 2     \;  \mid -3 \mid  = 3  \; \mid \frac{9}{2} \mid    =  \frac{9}{2}
 $$
 
## mathematic Definition  
we can  also  give a strict mathematical  formula   for  definition 

$$
|p| =
\begin{cases}
    p, & \text{if } p \geq 0 \\
    -p, & \text{if } p < 0
\end{cases}
$$
this tell us to drop the absolute  notation for p  if it is  positive , if it negative then add a negative sign  at the beginning 
So  here are a couple of quick example   
$$
\begin{aligned}
    |4| &= 4 \quad &\text{because } 4 \geq 0 \\
    |-8| &= -(-8) = 8 \quad &\text{because } -8 < 0 \\
    |0| &= 0 \quad &\text{because } 0 \geq 0
\end{aligned}
$$
note that we used the same definition  for  geometric interpretation 
one way to think of  absolute value is that it  input  put a  number and make it positive 
$$
\mid p \mid \geq  0  
$$
regardless of the value of    p 

we  need to  be careful to not miss used the definition of this value  .  for example  we cannot used the definition on  
$$\mid -x \mid   $$because  we don't know if x is positive or negative 
don't make the assumption that positive will make all the negative sign  into  positive one   for example   
$$
\mid  4x    -3  \mid     \neq  4x  + 3  
$$
this equation   answer is not true , to prove it let plug in  some number 
$$
7=|−7|=|4(−1)−3|≠4(−1)+3=−1
$$
1.  the two number when  evaluated  are not the same  
2. second the number on the right is negative while the number on  the left is positive  


$$|p|=4$$
Now, if we think of this from a geometric point of view this means that whatever pp is it must have a distance of 4 from the origin. Well there are only two numbers that have a distance of 4 from the origin, namely 4 and -4. So, there are two solutions to this equation,

$$p=−4\;  or\; p=4$$
Now  , if you think of it  we can do  this  for any positive number  not including  4 leading to the following formula  for the equation 
$$If  \; |p|=b,b>0 \;then \;p=−b\;or p=b$$ this only  apply if b is a positive number we will look  at cases where b is negative or  zero 
## solve each of the following equation 

$$\begin{array}{l}
\mid 2x  -  5  \mid   = 9   \\
 \left\{
\begin{array}{l} 
2x  -  5 =  - 9  \\
2x  -  5  =  +   9     \\

\end{array} \\

\right.    
\implies
 \left\{
\begin{array}{l} 
x   =  -2  \\
x  =   7    \\

\end{array} \\

\right.
\end{array} $$$$
\begin{array}{l}
\mid 1-  3t  \mid   =  20   \\
\left\{
\begin{array}{l} 
 1-  3t = 20  \\
 1-  3t = - 20    \\

\end{array} \\

\right.    
\implies
 \left\{
\begin{array}{l} 
x   =  -\frac{19}{3}   \\
x  =   7 \\

\end{array} \\

\right.

$$
\begin{array}{l}
\mid 5y  - 8 \mid  =  1  \\
\left\{
\begin{array}{l} 
5y  - 8 = 1  \\
5y  - 8 = -1    \\

\end{array} \\

\right.    
\implies
 \left\{
\begin{array}{l} 
x   =  \frac{9}{5}  \\
x  =    \frac{7}{5}\\

\end{array} \\

\right.
\end{array}

## where  b is  zero or negative  
$$\begin{array}{l}
\mid 15x  + 9  \mid   = -3 \\

\end{array} $$ there is  $|p|≥0$ .  In other word we  cannot get  a  ne
