There are two method of solving  exponential equation . One method is simple but require a special form of exponential  equation . The other will work on  more complicated  exponential equation but can get a little messy 
let start by having a look at these simple method  ; 
$$
\text{if } b^x   = b^y  \text{ then } x =  y  
$$
if it isn't then this fact will do us no good 
$$
\begin{array}{l} \\
5^{3x}  =  5^{7x  - 2}    \\
3x  =  7x   - 2   \\
x = \frac{1}{2}
\end{array}
$$

$$
\begin{array}{l}  \\
4^{t^2} = 4^{6 - t}  \\
t^2  = 6 - t \
x = \frac{1}{2}
\end{array}
$$
