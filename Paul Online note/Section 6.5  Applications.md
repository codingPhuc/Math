## Compound Interest 

This application is compound interest and there are two application that we will be looking at . 

If were to Put P dollar into an account that earns interest rate of r (written as decimal) for t years (yes , it must be years) 

1. If interest is compound m times per year we will have 
$$
A  = P\left( 1  + \frac{r}{m} \right)^{t \cdot m  }
$$

dollars after t ye
