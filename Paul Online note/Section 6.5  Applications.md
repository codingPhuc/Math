in this final section of the chapter we will look at applications of exponential and logarithm function 

## Compound Interest 

This application is compound interest and there are two application that we will be looking at . 

If were to Put P dollar into an account that earns interest rate of r (written as decimal) for t years (yes , it must be years) 

1. If interest is compound m times per year we will have 
$$
A  = P\left( 1  + \frac{r}{m} \right)^{t \cdot m  }
$$

dollars after t year 
2. if interest i compound continuously then  we will have 
$$
A =   Pe^{r \cdot t}
$$
dollar after t years  


Example 1 We are going to invest $100,000 in an account that earns interest at a rate of 7.5% for 54 months. Determine how much money will be in the account if,
1. interest is compounded quarterly.
$$
A  = 100,000\left( 1  + \frac{7.5}{12} \right)^{4.5 \cdot 12}  = 139706.68 
$$

2. interest is compounded monthly.
$$
A  = 100,000\left( 1  + \frac{7.5}{4} \right)^{4.5 \cdot 4 }  = 1399996 
$$
3. interest is compounded continuously. 


$$
A =  100000 \cdot e^{t}  
$$
