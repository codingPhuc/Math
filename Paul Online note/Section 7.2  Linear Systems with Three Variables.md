# #definition 
$$
\begin{array}{l}  \\
x - 2y +  3z  = 7  \\
2x + y + z = 4  \\
-3x + 2y -2z  = -10  
\end{array}
$$


We  are going to try to find value of z , y and z will satisfy all three equation at one . We are going to use elimination to eliminate one variable from one of  the equation and two variables from another equation 


in this cases if we multiply the second equation by 2 then it will be easier to eliminate the second and third equation 

$$
\begin{array}{l}
 x -  2y +  3z =  7   \xrightarrow{\text{same}} x - 2y + 3z = 7  \\
2x +  y + z = 4  \xrightarrow{\text{x 2}}  4x +2y + 2z  = 8 \\
-3x  + 2y -2z =  -10 \xrightarrow{\text{same}} -3x + 2y -2z  = -10   
\end{array}
$$
Now with this new system  we will replace the third and second equation with the sum of the first with the second and third 
here is the resulting equation : 
$$
\begin{array}{l} \\
x  - 2y + 3z   = 7   \\
5x  +  5z  =  15  \\
-2x  + z =  -3  
\end{array}
$$
So ,  we've eliminated one of the variables from  two of the equations . Now either eliminate x or z from the third or second  equation . We will used  elimination to do this by multiplying the third  by -5


$$
\begin{array}{l}
x  - 2y + 3z   = 7   \xrightarrow{\text{same}} x  - 2y + 3z   = 7   \\
5x  +  5z  =  15   \xrightarrow{\text{ same}} 5x  +  5z  =  15  \\
-2x  + z =  -3  \xrightarrow{\times\text{ -5}} 10x   -5 z =  15  
\end{array}
$$

Now replace the third and second equation with sum of the second and third 
$$
\begin{array}{l} \\
x  - 2y + 3z   = 7   \\
5x  +  5z  =  15  \\
15x  =  30 
\end{array}
$$
now solve the linear system  with  three solution 
$$
\begin{array}{l}  \\
x =  2   \\
5z  =  15 - 5 \cdot 2   \implies z =   1    \\
2  -  2y  + 3 \cdot 1   = 7 \implies y  = -1  
\end{array}
$$


## example  2 solve the following system  of equation 



$$
\begin{array}{l}  \\
2x  -  4y  +  5z  = -33   \\
4x  - y =  -5  \\
-2x  + 2y - 3z  = 19  
\end{array}
$$


We  are going to try to find value of z , y and z will satisfy all three equation at one . We are going to use elimination to eliminate one variable from one of  the equation and two variables from another equation 


in this cases if we multiply the second equation by -4 and the third equation by 2  then it will be easier to eliminate the second and third equation 

$$
\begin{array}{l}
2x  -  4y  +  5z  = -33   \xrightarrow{\text{same}} x - 2y + 3z = 7  \\
4x  - y =  -5  \xrightarrow{\text{x -4}}  -16x   + 4y     = 20   \\
-2x  + 2y - 3z  = 19   \xrightarrow{\text{same}} -3x + 2y -2z  = -10   
\end{array}
$$
Now with this new system  we will replace the third and second equation with the sum of the first with the second and third 
here is the resulting equation : 
$$
\begin{array}{l} \\
x  - 2y + 3z   = 7   \\
5x  +  5z  =  15  \\
-2x  + z =  -3  
\end{array}
$$
So ,  we've eliminated one of the variables from  two of the equations . Now either eliminate x or z from the third or second  equation . We will used  elimination to do this by multiplying the third  by -5


$$

5x  +  5z  =  15   \xrightarrow{\text{ same}} 5x  +  5z  =  15  \\
-2x  + z =  -3  \xrightarrow{\times\text{ -5}} 10x   -5 z =  15  
\end{array}
$$

Now replace the third and second equation with sum of the second and third 
$$
\begin{array}{l} \\
x  - 2y + 3z   = 7   \\
5x  +  5z  =  15  \\
15x  =  30 
\end{array}
$$
now solve the linear system  with  three solution 
$$
\begin{array}{l}  \\
x =  2   \\
5z  =  15 - 5 \cdot 2   \implies z =   1    \\
2  -  2y  + 3 \cdot 1   = 7 \implies y  = -1  
\end{array}
$$
