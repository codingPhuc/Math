$$
\begin{array}{l}  \\
x - 2y +  3z  = 7  \\
2x + y + z = 4  \\
-3x + 2y -2z  = -10  
\end{array}
$$


We  are going to try to find value of z , y and z will satisfy all three equation at one . We are going to use elimination to eliminate one variable from one of  the equation and two variables from another equation 


in this cases if we multiply the second equation by 2 then it will be easier to eliminate the second and third equation 

$$
\begin{aligned}
&6x  - 5y  =  8 \\
& -12x  +   2y  = 0  \\
\\
&\text{Multiply the first equation by } 2: \\
&12x  - 10y  =  16 \\
&\text{Second equation remains the same: }  -12x   +   2y  = 0  \\
\\
&\text{Add the equations:} \\
&( 12x   -12x  ) + ( - 10y    +   2y  ) = 16 \\
&-8y = 16 \\
&y = -2  \\
&x =  \frac{1}{3} 
\end{aligned}
$$
