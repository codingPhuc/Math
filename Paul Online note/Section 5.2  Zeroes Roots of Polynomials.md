Root of zero  of a polynomial is . We say that $x=r$  is a root of zero of a polynomial , $P(x)$ if $P(r)=0$ . In other word  $x=r$ is a root of 0 polynomial  if it is a solution to the equation $P(x)=0$ 

In the next section we need to find all zeros for the given polynomial . So , before that we need to get some idea out of the way regarding zeroes of a polynomials that will help us in that process 


The process for finding root of zero amount to nothing more than solving the equation $P(x)=0$ and we know how to do that for second degree(quadratic) polynomials . So, to help illustrate some of the idea we will be doing some example : 
Let's  first find the zeros  for  $P(x) =x^2 + 2x  - 15$ to do this we simply solve the following equation 

$$
\begin{array}{l } 
x^2 + 2x  - 15   = 0 \\
(x + 5) (x - 3 )   = 0  \\
\left\{  \\
 \begin{array}{l} 
x=  -5   \\
x =  3 \\
\end{array}
 \right.
\end{array}

$$
So , this second degree have two zero roots  . 

Now , let's find the zeros for $P(x) =x^2 -14x+49$ that will mean solving , 
$$
\begin{array}{l}   
x^2  -  14x   +  49  \\
\left \\
\end{array}
$$
