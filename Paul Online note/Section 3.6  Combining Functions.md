in this topic we are dealing with combining function . This mean to perform basic arithmetic (addition , subtraction , and division   ) . There is one new way of combing functions that we will look into 

let start with basic arithmetic of function . give the two function $f(x)$ and  $g(x)$ we have the following notation and operation 



Sometimes we will drop  (x) part and just write the following 

notice that if put x in the  parenthesis  we often put the number in as well 

$$
\begin{array}{l}
f(x)  = 2 + 3x - x^2    \\
g(x ) = 2x  - 1  
\end{array}
$$
1. $(f+g)(4)$
$$
\begin{array}{l}
(f+g)(4) \\
2+  3\cdot 4   -4^2   + 2\cdot 4  - 1   = 5 
\end{array}
$$


2. $gâˆ’f$
$$
\begin{array}{l}
(g-f )\\
2  +  3x   - x^2  - 2x   + 1   = -x^2 + x + 3 
\end{array}
$$
3. $(fg)(x)$
$$
\begin{array}{l}
(fg)(x)\\
(2 + 3x - x^2 )(2x  -  1)   =  4x   +  6x^2 - 2x^3  -  2 -3x+ x^2  = - 2x^3 + 7x^2 - 2  
\end{array}
$$
4. $\left( \frac{f}{g} \right)(0)$

$$
\begin{array}{l}
\left( \frac{f}{g} \right)(0)\\
\frac{2 + 3x - x^2 }{2x  - 1   }    = \frac{2 + 3\cdot 0  - 0^2 }{2\cdot 0  - 1   }  =-2 
\end{array}
$$

Now we need to discuss the new method of combining function . The new method is called **function composition** here is the definition 

give two function $f(x)$  $g(x)$ we have the following definition 
$$
\begin{array}{l}
(f \circ  g) (x)  = f[g(x)]  \\

\end{array}
$$
The **composition  of**  $f(x)$ and   $g(x)$   (again ,  the note the order ) is : 
$$
\begin{array}{l}
(g \circ f) (x) = g [f(x)] \\

\end{array}
$$

there are a few thing to note about function fusion . First this is **NOT** multiplication . Regales  of what the notation suggest  this is not multiplication 

Second,  the order we list the function  is very important , since it can be different depend on the order we listed them
