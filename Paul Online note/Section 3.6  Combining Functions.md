in this topic we are dealing with combining function . This mean to perform basic arithmetic (addition , subtraction , and division   ) . There is one new way of combing functions that we will look into 

let start with basic arithmetic of function . give the two function $f(x)$ and  $g(x)$ we have the following notation and operation 



Sometimes we will drop  (x) part and just write the following 

notice that if put x in the  parenthesis  we often put the number in as well 

$$
\begin{array}{l}
f(x)  = 2 + 3x - x^2    \\
g(x ) = 2x  - 1  
\end{array}
$$
1. $(f+g)(4)$

2. $g−f$

3. $(fg)(x)$

4. $(fg)(0)$
