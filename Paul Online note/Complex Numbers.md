we won’t get a real number out of a square root of a negative number, $\sqrt{ -9 }$ is  not a real number due to the fact that  there is no number that we can square to get a negative 9 
now we know that [[Radicals#**Exponent Rules with Roots**]] that $\sqrt{ ab} =  \sqrt{ a }\sqrt{ b }$  for a second let forget that restriction and do the following  : 
$\sqrt{ -9 } = \sqrt{ 9 .-1 } = \sqrt{ 9 }\sqrt{  -1}=3\sqrt{ -1 }$ 
now $\sqrt{ -1 }$ is not a negative number 
we can now do this for every square roots of a negative number for instances 
$$\begin{aligned}\sqrt{-100}&=\sqrt{100}\sqrt{-1}=10\sqrt{-1}\\\sqrt{-5}&=\sqrt{5}\sqrt{-1}\\\sqrt{-290}&=\sqrt{290}\sqrt{-1}\quad etc.\end{aligned}$$ so in conclusion if we deal with -1 then we can deal with any square root of number . Well the reality is that,  at this level there is not way to deal with $\sqrt{ -1 }$ so instead of dealing with it we will make it go aways using the following definition 
i = $\sqrt{ -1 }$ 
note that if we square both side we will get 
$i^2 =  -1$ 
we can see that i is the only number we can square to get a negative value  
$$\begin{aligned}\sqrt{-9}&=3\operatorname{i}&\sqrt{-100}&=10\operatorname{i}\\\sqrt{-5}&=\sqrt{5}\operatorname{i}&\sqrt{-290}&=\sqrt{290}\operatorname{i}\end{aligned}$$
These are all examples of complex number  
The reason  why we discuss them here is because in the next chapter we need a way to deal with 
square root of negative number. So to deal with them we need complex number 
basic terminology for complex numbers. The standard form of a complex number is  : 
$a + bi$ 
where a and b are real number and they can be anything, positive , negative , zero, integers , fraction , decimal . When in standard form a is  the call the real part of the complex number and b is called the imaginary part of the complex number  
here are some example of a complex number .  
$$\begin{array}{cccccc}3+5i&&\sqrt{6}-10i&&\frac{4}{5}+i&&16i&&113\end{array}$$
in the last two section 16i and  113 , 16i not having a real part of a complex number mean it is place in the imaginary number category. On the other hand, 113 is purely a real number with it imaginary part not showing 

## conjure 
conjure of a complex number is the sign  on the imaginary part changing   
complex number 
$\begin{gathered}3+\frac{1}{2}i\\12-5i\\1-i\\45i\\101\end{gathered}$
conjugate 
$\begin{aligned}&3-\frac{1}{2}i\\&12+5i\\&1+i\\&-45i\\&101\end{aligned}$
we need to discuss the basic operations for complex number . We ll start with addition and subtraction. The easiest way to think of adding and subtracting complex number is to think of each complex number as a polynomials and do adding or subtractions in the same way we do polynomials 
$(-4 + 7i) + (5-10i) =1-3i$  
$(4+12i)-(3-15i) = 1+27i$
$5i - (-9+i) = 4i+9$
 Multiply each of the following and write the answers in standard form.
$7i(-5+2i)=-35i+14i^2$ 
$(1-5i)(-9+2i)=-9+2i+45i-10i^2=-10i^2+47i-9$ 
$(1-8i)(1+8i)=1-8i+8i-8^2i^2=1-64i^2$ 




# Practice problem  


$$
\begin{array} {l} \\
(4 -  5i) (12 + 11i)    \\
= 48  +  44i   - 60i  - 55i^2   \\
= -55i^2  -16i   +  44i   \\

 
\end{array}

$$




$$
\begin{array} {l} \\
(- 3  -  i)  -  ( 6 - 7i) \\
=  -3  - i    -  6  +  7i   \\
=  -9   + 6i   \\
 
\end{array}

$$



$$
\begin{array} {l} \\
(1 + 4i)  - (-16 + 9i)\\ 
=  1+  4i  + 16  -  9i   \\
= -5i  + 17  
 
\end{array}

$$  
$$
\begin{array} {l} \\
8i (10 + 2i)  \\
= 80i  +  16i^2 
\end{array}

$$


  
$$
\begin{array} {l} \\
(-3  -  9i )   (1 + 10i)\\ 
= -3 - 30i  - 9i - 90i^2   \\
= -90i^2  - 39i  - 3  
\end{array}

$$


  
$$
\begin{array} {l} \\
(2  +  7i )   (8 +  3i)\\ 
=  16 +  6i  +  56i   +  21i^2 \\  \\
= 21i^2  +  62i  + 16 
\end{array}

$$ 

$$
\begin{array} {l} \\
(2  +  7i )   (8 +  3i)\\ 
=  16 +  6i  +  56i   +  21i^2 \\  \\
