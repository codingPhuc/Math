You are asking for an example to further illustrate the meaning of the **supremum (least upper bound)** as "the smallest real number that is greater than or equal to all elements in this set."

Let's use an example directly from the sources:

Consider the set **E** defined as the **interval of real numbers from 0 to 1, inclusive**: **E := {x ∈ R : 0 ≤ x ≤ 1}**.

Here's how the concept of supremum applies to this set:

1. **Upper Bounds for E**:
    
    - A **real number M is an upper bound for E if x ≤ M for every element x in E**.
    - For the set E = {x ∈ R : 0 ≤ x ≤ 1}, **1 is an upper bound** because every element of E is less than or equal to 1.
    - However, 1 is not the _only_ upper bound. For example, **2 is also an upper bound for E**, as is any number greater than or equal to 1.
    - A number like 0.5, on the other hand, is not an upper bound, because it is not larger than _every_ element in E (e.g., 0.5 is not larger than 0.7 or 1).
2. **The Supremum (Least Upper Bound) of E**:
    
    - The **supremum (least upper bound)** of E is an upper bound **M** such that **any other upper bound M' for E must be larger than or equal to M**.
    - For the set E = {x ∈ R : 0 ≤ x ≤ 1}, **1 is the least upper bound**.
    - While 2 is an upper bound, it's not the _least_ because 1 is also an upper bound and 1 < 2.
    - **1 fits the definition perfectly: it is an upper bound, and any other number that is an upper bound for E (e.g., 1.5, 2, 100) must be greater than or equal to 1**.

Therefore, for the set **E = {x ∈ R : 0 ≤ x ≤ 1}**, its supremum is **sup(E) = 1**. This is the **smallest real number that is greater than or equal to all elements in this set**.
