### ✍️ **Ideas for Personal Shortcut Use in Notes**

You can even invent your own consistent shortcuts for words like:

| Symbol  | Shortcut For                               | Example                            |
| ------- | ------------------------------------------ | ---------------------------------- |
| ≠       | "Not equal"                                | x≠yx ≠ y means x is not equal to y |
| ↑ ↓ → ← | "Increase, decrease, leads to, comes from" | Profit ↑ = good                    |
| ⟹       | "Leads to / Results in"                    | Mutation ⟹ Disease                 |
| #****   | "Number" or "count"                        | # of genes = 20,000                |
| %       | "Percent"                                  | 80% efficiency                     |
| ∆       | "Change in"                                | ∆x = x₂ - x₁                       |
| ~       | "Similar to"                               | A ~ B                              |
